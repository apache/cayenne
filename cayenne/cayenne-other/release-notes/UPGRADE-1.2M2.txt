Cayenne Upgrade Information 1.2 Milesone (M2)
Date: 
============================================

WARNING !!!! Most API deprecated in 1.1 is removed.


1. General Upgrade Advise:

-  You should expect Modeler to be backwards compatible and be able to read 
   older project files. However once you save such file, the latest format will be used, possibly 
   making saved project incompatible with older versions of the Modeler (and runtime).

-  Clean Recompile: Cayenne 1.1 introduces a few API changes. Most of them are done 
   to the backend and should not affect the applications written with the earlier versions. 
   However it is a good idea to perform a clean compilation of all Java code that relies on 
   Cayenne. Updating calls to deprecated methods is also a very good idea.
