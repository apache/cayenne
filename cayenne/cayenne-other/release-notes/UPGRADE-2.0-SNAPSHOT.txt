Apache Cayenne Upgrade Information
==================================


UPGRADING FROM 1.2 AND OTHER OBJECTSTYLE RELEASES

As you may know, Cayenne is now released from Apache, so the only change compared 
to 1.2 release is that all "org.objectstyle.*" java packages where replaced with 
"org.apache.*" analogues. Otherwise the API is identical to ObjectStyle Cayenne 
1.2-final.

* Upgrading mapping files:

To upgrade the mapping files, open them in the new Modeler. You should see an upgrade 
dialog. Once you confirm the upgrade 

* Upgrading the code:

Replace "org.objectstyle." with "org.apache." everywhere in imports and do a clean 
recompile.

* Upgrading logging configuration

If you are using custom logging configuration file, make sure that all the 
Cayenne loggers are changed from "org.objectstyle" to "org.apache".
