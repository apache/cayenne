Changes/New Features:

* Fixed cross-platform CayenneModeler startup issue.

* MacOSX CayenneModeler will now use Aqua look and feel by default. 
  If you already used Cayenne on Mac, you may need to delete the old preferences.
  Go to "/Users/username/.cayenne/modeler.preferences" and remve the following lines: 
       Editor.lookAndFeel=...
       Editor.theme=...
       
* New method: DataObjectUtils.objectForQuery(DataContext, Query)
* Remote Object Persistence:
  - added 'localObjects' to ObjectContext interface.
  
* SQLTemplate no longer requires users to specify whether it is selecting or not. 
  This information is really redundant and can be determined from JDBC in runtime.
  FrontBase note: you will need FrontBase JDBC driver newer than version 2.5.2. 
  Older driver will not work due to this change.

Other Bugs Fixed:

* CayenneModeler doesn't react to change in adapter name.
* CAY-410	Endless loop on remote notifications
* CAY-374	Generate explicit error message instead of silently ignoring lack of support for Generated columns
* CAY-413	DataMaps and DataNodes must be alphabetically sorted in the Modeler and cayenne.xml
* CAY-408	cayenne.xml not found in servlet context path though it is there
* CAY-403	Incorrect FK statement during schema generation for cross-DB relationships
