Changes/New Features:

* Prefetching... CAY-285, CAY-296. For details see this article - http://objectstyle.org/confluence/display/CAY/Prefetching 
  - Selecting queries store prefetches using PrefetchTreeNode.
  - joint prefetch API (addJointPrefetch, etc.) is removed from SelectQuery, SQLTemplate, ProcedureQuery.
    Instead Cayenne will try to guess prefetch strategy in runtime. Alternatively users can provide a hint 
    about a desired strategy by changing the semantics of desired PrefetchTreeNode.
  
* New FrontBaseAdapter, with support for BLOB/CLOB, batch updates, etc.

* Support for batch updates on PostgreSQL. I am seeing almost 2x increase in speed for large inserts.

* CAY-190	Now calling "setFetchLimit" on a query is not just a hint to Cayenne on how to process a 
   ResultSet in memory. It includes an appropriate LIMIT clause in generated SELECT SQL for Oracle, 
   Postgres, FrontBase, Openbase, MySQL and HSQLDB databases, resulting in measurable performance increase.
