Cayenne Upgrade Information 1.2 M4 milestone
Date: May 7, 2005
============================================

GENERAL UPGRADE NOTES:

*  WARNING: Most API deprecated in 1.1 is removed from 1.2.

*  For the complete list of new features since the last stable release see 
    User Guide page at  [cayenne_install_dir]/doc/userguide/introduction/whats-new.html

*  Expect CayenneModeler to be backwards compatible and be able to read 
   older project files. However once you save old projects with new Modeler, 
   the latest format will be used, possibly making saved project incompatible 
   with older versions of the Modeler and runtime.

*  Clean Recompile: Cayenne 1.1 introduces a few API changes. Most of them are done 
   to the backend and should not affect the applications written with the earlier versions. 
   However it is a good idea to perform a clean compilation of all Java code that relies on 
   Cayenne. Updating calls to deprecated methods is also a very good idea.
   
   
UPGRADE NOTES:

*  In 1.2 PostgreSQLAdapter uses DB sequences for primary key generation instead of 
    AUTO_PK_TABLE. To port an existing application, you will need to create those 
    sequences (e.g. using the Modeler) and assign correct current values to them 
    (e.g. taken from the old AUTO_PK_TABLE). After that AUTO_PK_TABLE can be dropped.
