Changes/New Features:

* CAY-79	Improvements to Ant cgen task; new ClassGenerator functions

* CAY-264 An early preview of distributed data contexts.

* CAY-261 XML Encoder/Decoder - this feature is usable now, though still should be considered unstable.

* DataPort Ant task is moved from examples to the main tree and is included with Antlib.

* SQLTemplateExecutionPlan and SQLTemplateSelectExecutionPlan classes are removed from 
  Cayenne. Keeping it in deprecated state is no longer possible due to SQLAction method 
  signature changes.
  
* A change in the order of loading resources via ResourceLocator (this includes cayenne.xml loading). 
  Now custom classpath locations take precedence over the default one.
  
* Changing default MySQL mapping of JDBC TIMESTAMP to be "DATETIME". This is a more sensible default as TIMESTAMP
  is autoinitialized by MySQL on insert.
  
* SelectQuery resolves its prefetches during the routing phase. Users who did prefetch query filtering via
  DataContextDelegate must be aware of this change.
