Changes/New Features:

* Nested DataContext commits.

* Modeler features platform-native keyboard shortcuts. I.e. Mac users will no longer have 
  to figure out where the "Ctrl" key is located. Command-S will save the project.

* Added FK constraints support to MySQLAdapter. It is enabled automatically if the AutoAdapter
  detects that InnoDB table type is default. I.e. if you want it to operate in a DB-independent fashion,
  do not expicitly set MySQLAdapter in the Modeler and let Cayenne guess it.

* Support for custom cgen templates located in jar files. Prior to M12 custom templates were only
  accessible if as files in the local filesystem.

* SingleObjectQuery is renamed to ObjectIdQuery to reflect the fact that it supports data rows as well. 
  For documentation see http://objectstyle.org/confluence/display/CAY/ObjectIdQuery

* First cut of the new IngresAdapter.
