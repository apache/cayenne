Changes/New Features:

* DataObjectUtils.objectForQuery(..) now returns Object instead of DataObject to accomodate DataRows, 
  Persistent objects, etc. If you are using this method, you may need to use a cast.
* "opp" package and all classes whose names started with OPP* were renamed. Check a 'web.xml' 
  descriptor and change the following configuration parameters to reflect the new names:
  
  - cayenne.OPPRemoteService.EventBridge.factory to cayenne.RemoteService.EventBridge.factory
  - org.objectstyle.cayenne.opp.hessian.HessianServlet to org.objectstyle.cayenne.remote.hessian.service.HessianServlet
  
* WebApplicationListener and WebApplicationContextProvider are deprecated. Now the official choice for webapp
  configuration is WebApplicationContextFilter. Still users are free to use custom listeners if they choose to do 
  so, i.e. the deprecation is done to reduce confusion regarding the choices, not because the listener approach doesn't work.
