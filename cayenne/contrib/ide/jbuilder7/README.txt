This directory contains project files for the Borland JBuilder 7 IDE (http://www.borland.com).

To setup Cayenne as an JBuilder project, check out the code, and copy the two
files in this directory (cayenne.jpx and cayenne-deps.library) into the root "cayenne"
directory. After that you can open the project in JBuilder. All the path references must
be valid. If any third party jars change their names edit the library dependencies locally.
I edited .cvsignore accordingly, still please be sure not to try to check in anything
created by JBuilder.
