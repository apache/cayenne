Defines standard queries supported by Cayenne and extension mechanism to create
custom queries. Many of the queries in this package are used by the framework internally. 
Normally users would only care about these general query classes: 
<ul>
	<li>SelectQuery</li>
	<li>SQLTemplate</li>
	<li>ProcedureQuery</li>
</ul>
	
and sometimes - these specialized queries:

<ul>
	<li>QueryChain</li>
	<li>RelationshipQuery</li>
	<li>SingleObjectQuery</li>
</ul>

<p>Cayenne can "execute" any object as a query as long as it implements 
Query interface and provides meaningful implementation of either <em>Query.route(...)</em> 
and/or 
<em>Query.createSQLAction(SQLActionVisitor)}</em> methods. 
So users can extend/customize queries if they need to. Custom implementations would 
normally either create a query from a standard Cayenne set 
and delegate the execution to it (acting as a sort of "query builder"),
or can implement its own non-standard SQLAction.</p>
