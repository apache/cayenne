 * Defines a set of object states from the point of view of persistence. I.e.
 * PersistenceState is the state of data stored in an object relative to the external

 * object is COMMITTED. If object is not intended to be persistent or is not explicitly
 * made persistent, the state is TRANSIENT, and so on.
 * <p>
 * Object persistence states should not be modified directly. Rather it is a
 * responsibility of a ObjectContext/DataContext to maintain correct state of the managed
