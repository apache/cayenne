<p>Contains classes that make up Cayenne generic event dispatch mechanism. 
	The central class is EventManager that allows to completely decouple 
	event senders from listeners. EventBridge allows to connect a network of EventManagers
    in a single "virtual" EventManager. This includes managers running in different
