Contains model classes used by CayenneModeler or any other
MVC type of application to work with Cayenne project files. Like 
any good model in MVC, it is independent from a specific GUI layer. 

<p><code>org.apache.cayenne.project</code> package views the objects that
comprise project tree from the point of <strong>semantics</strong>
rather than logical relationships. It is normally not used in deployment.</p>

<p><code>org.apache.cayenne.project</code> package provides safe implementations of
read/write operations on Cayenne project and handles validation, using validators 
from <code>org.apache.cayenne.project.validator</code> package.
