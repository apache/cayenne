 	 	<p>To quickly start a new project based on an existing database, CayenneModeler
 	 	"reverse engineering" functionality is used. Cayenne will create an exact model
 	 	of the database schema, and extrapolate it to the object layer. DataMaps created 
		during reverse engineering will contain metadata for Java business layer.
 	 	The names of classes and their properties
 	 	will be compatible with Java naming conventions. E.g for a table 
 	 	called "USER_TYPE", a class named "UserType" will be created in the mapping.
