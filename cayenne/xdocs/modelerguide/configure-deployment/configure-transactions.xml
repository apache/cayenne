        	<p>Each DataDomain can be configured to explicitly commit/rollback its transactions or to rely on 
        	deployment container to do that. This is done by checking or unchecking "Container-Managed
	 		Transactions" checkbox. 
	 		</p><p>
	 		By default "Container-Managed Transactions" is unchecked, letting Cayenne to handle its
	 		transactions. Check this checkbox when using Cayenne under container-managed transactions 
	 		control, i.e. within EJB environment.</p>
