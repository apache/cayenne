            <p>Cayenne stores mapping and deployment information using a set of XML files with a predefined
            format. These files can be always edited by hand, but Cayenne goes beyond that. A
            standard distribution contains CayenneModeler - a Java Swing GUI application that serves
            as an Object/Relational modeling tool. It is much more than just a specialized XML editor. 
            It provides a comprehensive set of O/R functions, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Work with Cayenne mapping projects.</li>
            	<li>Reverse-engineering RDBMS schema into Cayenne DataMaps.</li>
            	<li>Generation of the database schema from the mapping information stored in DataMaps.</li>
            	<li>Java class generation from the mapping information stored in DataMaps.</li>
            	<li>Management of the project deployment structure and database connection
            	information.</li>
            	<li>Validation of created mappings.</li>
            	<li>Import from some other O/R model formats (EOF).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Among other things CayenneModeler allows new users to learn the concepts used in 
            Cayenne framework, its terminology, and the overall structure.</p> 
            
            <p>The following chapters of this Guide discuss how to use various functions of CayenneModeler.
