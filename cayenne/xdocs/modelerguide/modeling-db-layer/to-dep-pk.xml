				<p>Some DB relationships consist only of the primary key 
					columns of the participating tables. Examples of such 
					relationships are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>One-to-one relationship between master and detail 
						tables.</li>
					<li>One-to-many relationship between each main table and a 
						join table in a many-to-many relationship spanning 
						three tables.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Normally one side of the relationship is considered "master" 
					and another one - "dependent", meaning that "dependent" 
					part can not exist without a corresponding "master" record, 
					while "master" record can exist without any dependents. 
					This fact is reflected in Cayenne mapping. DbEntity 
					"Relationships" panel contains "To Dep PK" column. The 
					checkboxes in this column are disabled, unless the 
					relationship only consists of the PK attributes. If this is 
					the case, you must select the relationship going in the 
					direction from "master" to "dependent" and check the "To 
					Dep PK" checkbox on this relationship. Otherwise Cayenne 
					will not be able to handle such relationship properly.</p>
