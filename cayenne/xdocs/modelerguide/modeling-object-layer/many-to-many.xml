	<p>Many-to-many relationships can be modeled in two different ways:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>By modeling a join table as an ObjEntity. This is the most trivial case
		but it makes traversing many-to-many relationships relatively inconvenient.</li>
		<li>Making join table transparent to the object model. This is achieved by using 
		<a href="flattenedrel.html">flattened relationships</a> discussed further in 
		this chapter.</li>
