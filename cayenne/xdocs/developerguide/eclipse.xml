        <section name="4. Using Eclipse IDE">
     	<p>Quiet a few Cayenne developers use <a href="http://eclipse.org">Eclipse 
        IDE</a>. Though of course this is by no means a requirement. This section documents the 
        process of setting up Eclipse for Cayenne project.
        	</p>
        	
        	<p>To setup Cayenne as an Eclipse project, check out the code, and copy the two
            files in <code>cayenne/contrib/ide/eclipse/</code> directory 
            (.classpath and .project) into the root "cayenne" directory, then import the 
            project into eclipse.</p>

			<p>If you have used eclipse to check out the tree (much easier!) you can use
			the Resource Navigator to copy the files. Either use copy/paste via the
			context menu or drag-and-CTRL-drop them to the root of the directory.</p>

			<p>If you have copied the files from outside eclipse (Windows Explorer,
			command line..) you will need to restart in order to have the project 
			recognized as 'Java project'.
