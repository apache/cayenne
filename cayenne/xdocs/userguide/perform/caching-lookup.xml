			<subsection name="11.5 Caching Lookup Tables">
            <p>Query result caching feature can be used to implement caching of lookup tables.
            "Lookup" or "configuration" tables can be loosely defined as small tables that change rarely
            and  mostly used in read-only fashion.   Examples of such tables are COUNTRY, USER_TYPE, 
            AREA_CODE, etc.  Often data from such tables is displayed in a combo box or dropdown.
            </p>
            
            <p>For performance reasons it makes sense to store the lookup data in the shared 
            cache. The following steps could be taken to create and use a shared query for a Country
            entity:</p>
            
            <ul>
            		<li>Create a named SelectQuery in CayenneModeler. Call it something like "AllCountries".
            		Select a root to be Country ObjEntity, select shared caching and uncheck "refresh" checkbox.
                <p> </p>
                </li>
                
                <li>Whenever a list of countries is needed, use a local DataContext to get it from cache - 
                <code>context.performQuery("AllCountries", false)</code>.
                <p> </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
