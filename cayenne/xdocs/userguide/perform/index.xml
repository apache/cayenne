    <section name="11. Performance Tuning">        
    <p>Most performance problems in database applications, including those using ORM,
    are related to the inefficient queries and/or large volumes of data in the database.
    Here is a few common issues that a typical application may run into:</p>
    
    <ul>
    	<li>Converting a large ResultSet into objects takes very long time.</li>
        <li>Storing objects from a large ResultSet takes large amounts of memory. 
        Application may eventually run out of memory and crash.</li>
        <li>Given a list of objects, there may be a need to retrieve a list
        of related objects. Often this is done in a suboptimal way, by issuing 
        a single query for each dependent object.</li>
    </ul>
           
    <p>There is no single solution to all performance problems.
    Cayenne offers a few strategies to improve performance. They should be
    applied where appropriate.</p>
