        	 <subsection name="4.8 How Information Is Stored in Cayenne">
        	 <p>There are two types of data items stored by Cayenne - DataObjects and DataRows.</p>
        	 
        	 <p><a href="../../api/cayenne/org/objectstyle/cayenne/DataObject.html">DataObject</a> graph 
        	 is stored by instances of <a href="../../api/cayenne/org/objectstyle/cayenne/access/ObjectStore.html">ObjectStore</a>
        	 associated with every DataContext. As discussed earlier, "graph" is simply a number of DataObjects 
        	 interconnected with each other via relationships.</p>
        	 
        	 <p><a href="../../api/cayenne/org/objectstyle/cayenne/DataRow.html">DataRows</a> are 
        	 snapshots of database table rows. They are stored by <a href=
        	 "../../api/cayenne/org/objectstyle/cayenne/access/DataRowStore.html">DataRowStore</a>.  
        	 DataRows are used internally for many tasks performed by Cayenne, including creation
        	 of DataObjects, tracking changes to DataObjects, caching.
        	 </p>
        	 
        	 <p>Both DataRowStore and ObjectStore use ObjectIds as lookup keys to their corresponding 
        	 data items.</p>
        	 
        	 <panel name="Note:">
        	 Relationship between ObjectStore and DataRow store is discussed in the caching chapter.
