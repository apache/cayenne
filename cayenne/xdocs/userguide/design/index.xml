			<p>This chapter describes design ideas and architecture of Cayenne. 
				It is not required to start using Cayenne, and there is no 
				hands-on information here. So new users can skip it initially 
				and come back later to gain better understanding of how Cayenne 
				operates under the hood.</p>
