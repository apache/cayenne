		<subsection name="10.1 Path Expressions">
		
		<p>Before we start discussing how to build expressions, it is important
		to understand one group of expressions widely used in Cayenne: <strong>path expressions</strong>. 
		There are two types of path expressions: <a href="../../api/cayenne/org/objectstyle/cayenne/exp/Expression.html#OBJ_PATH">object 
		path</a> used to navigate graphs of Java objects that follow Java Bean property naming conventions and  <a
		href="../../api/cayenne/org/objectstyle/cayenne/exp/Expression.html#DB_PATH">database path</a> used
		to navigate the database schema.</p>
		
		<p><strong>An Object Path Expression</strong> is a property navigation path. Such path is represented by a String 
		made of dot-separated names of properties of a Java Bean class. E.g. a path expression <code>"toArtist.artistName"</code>
		is a valid property path for a Painting class, pointing to the name of the Artist who created a given Painting. A few more 
		examples :</p>
        <ul>
             	<li><code>"paintingTitle"</code><br/> 
             		Can be used to navigate to the value of "paintingTitle" property of the Painting class.
             		<p></p>
             		</li>
             		
             		<li><code>"toArtist.exhibitArray.closingDate"</code><br/>
             		Can be used to navigate to a closing date of any of the exhibits of a Painting's Artist object.
             		<p></p>
             		</li>
		</ul>
		
		<panel name="What Does 'navigation' Means">
		The term "navigation" in the description above could mean different things depending on the context. 
		For instance, when evaluating an expression in memory, "navigating" an object path would simply return 
		the value of a corresponding object property. When the same expression is used in a select query qualifier, 
		it resolves to the name of a table column used in a WHERE clause of a generated SQL statement.
		</panel>
             	
		<p><b>Database Path Expressions</b> provide an easy way to navigate through DB table joins. Instead of 
		complex join semantics such expressions utilize the names of DbRelationships defined in Cayenne DataMap. 
		Translating the above object path examples into the DB realm, database path expressions might look like this:        	
		</p>
             	
             	<ul>
             		<li><code>"PAINTING_TITLE"</code><br/> 
             		Can be used to match the value of "PAINTING_TITLE" column of a PAINTING table.
             		<p></p>
             		</li>
             		
             		<li><code>"toArtist.artistExhibitArray.toExhibit.CLOSING_DATE"</code><br/>
             		Can be used to match a closing date of any of the exhibits of a related artist record.
             		<p></p>
             		</li>
             	</ul>
             	
             	<p>Though database path expressions are widely used by Cayenne framework internally, they are
             	rarely used in applications. There are only a few cases when their explicit use is justified.
