    <section name="10. Using Expressions">
    	<p>Cayenne defines a simple yet powerful object-based expression language. Cayenne expressions are database 
    	independent and are used as query qualifiers and orderings and also to perform in-memory evaluation with 
    	DataObjects (and generally any kind of Java Beans). BNF of Cayenne expression language is described 
    	<a href="../../grammar/ExpressionParser.html">here</a>.</p> 
    	
    	<p>Expressions are broadly divided into the following categories: object property expressions (also called "path expressions"), 
    	arithmetic operations, and conditional expressions. Cayenne contains a parser 
    	to build expressions from strings, and also features explicit expression API. Various ways of creating and using expressions
    	are described later in this chapter.
