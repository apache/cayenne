    	<subsection name="8.2 Flattened Relationships">
		<p>Flattened relationships represent relationship between two types of DataObjects that
		is not direct in the underlying relational storage. Instead it is mapped across one or more
		"join" tables. Still from the application point of view there is no diffrence in working with 
		flattened relationships compared to the "normal" ones. Cayenne internally figures out how to 
		build the needed query joins to retrieve related objects. On adding or removing an object to/from
		a flattened relationship via a corresponding "addTo..." / "removeFrom..." method an appropriate
		join record is created or removed.
		</p>

		<panel name="Flattened Relationships Limitations">Currently only many-to-many flattened
		relatationships with a single join table can be modified. All other types of flattened relationships
		can be used as "read-only". This is reflected in the DataObject code generated for such relationships -
		no set/addTo/RemoveFrom methods are created for read-only relationships.
