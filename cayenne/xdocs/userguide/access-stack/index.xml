		<section name="13. Access Stack Internals">
			<p>"Access stack" is a term used for the runtime engine in the 
				heart of Cayenne. Its operation conditions are defined by the 
				object-relational mapping and deployment information built 
				using CayenneModeler. As <a 
				href="../design/access.html">mentioned before</a>, "stack" is 
				composed of a number of layers working on top of each other: 
				Application API Layer, Query Routing Layer and Access Layer. 
				Part of the Application API Layer most visible to a user is of 
				course the DataContext that was discussed earlier. The goal of 
				this chapter is to demonstrate a number of advanced 
				customization features that involve other classes participating 
				in the access stack. </p>
