           <p>Cayenne application deployment is about configuring the application 
           so that at runtime it can find a main project file (cayenne.xml) and 
           associated resources, such as DataMap and DataNode XML files.
           </p>
           
           <p>The central point in Cayenne deployment is the
           	<a href="../../api/cayenne/org/objectstyle/cayenne/conf/Configuration.html">Configuration</a>
            class. It locates and loads all the mapping and configuration information required 
            for Cayenne at runtime. By default Configuration uses a singleton model, i.e. normally 
            there is only one instance of Configuration (or a subclass) that exists 
            in the application. This shared instance can be accessed in the following way:
            </p>

<source>import org.objectstyle.cayenne.conf.Configuration;
import org.objectstyle.cayenne.access.DataDomain;
...           
Configuration conf = Configuration.getSharedConfiguration();
DataDomain domain = conf.getDomain();
