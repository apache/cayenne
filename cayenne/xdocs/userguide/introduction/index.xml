			<p>Cayenne is a powerful, full-featured OpenSource Object/Relational framework. 
			Cayenne is written in Java and is intended for Java developers working with 
			relational databases. Cayenne has been successfully deployed in production 
			environments on high volume sites.</p>

            <p>Cayenne allows to reduce the development time in any database project 
            by creating an object-oriented abstraction of the database schema. Development
            teams using Cayenne will be able to concentrate on the core business 
            requirements and the data model instead of the SQL details.
            </p>
            
			<p>Among other things Cayenne provides management of persistent Java 
			objects mapped to relational databases, single method call queries and 
			updates (including atomic updates of all modified objects), seamless 
			integration of multiple databases into a single virtual data source. 
			Cayenne is distributed with CayenneModeler - a complete GUI mapping 
			tool that supports reverse-engineering of RDBMS schema, working with 
			database mappings and generation of Java source code for the persistent objects.
			</p>
			
			<p>Cayenne comes with a comprehensive set of HTML documentation and full source code,
			including source code for the GUI tools. Cayenne free support is provided via
			user mailing lists. Commerical support and consulting services
			are also available.
