            <p>If there is a need to rebuild Cayenne with custom modifications, the best way to
            do that is to check out the source
            from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=48132">anonymous CVS</a> (preferred 
            way) or to download one of the latest stable or development <a href=
            "http://objectstyle.org/downloads/cayenne/cvs-snapshots/">CVS snapshots</a>.
            See <a href="../../developerguide/index.html">Developer Guide</a> for details on how to 
            build Cayenne.  However since CVS checkout contains all needed dependencies (except for Java and Ant), 
            this should be very easy:</p>          

		<source>cd $CAYENNE_HOME/src
ant</source>
