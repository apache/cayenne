    	<p>Opening a 1.0 projects in CayenneModeler would display an upgrade
    	dialog. Select "Yes" button to perform the upgrade.

    	<subsection name="2.5.2 Clean Recompile">
    	<p>Cayenne 1.1 introduces a few API changes. Most of them are done to the backend and should not
    	affect the applications written with the earlier versions. However it is a good idea to perform a clean 
    	compilation of all Java code that relies on Cayenne. Updating calls to deprecated methods is a good idea 
    	as well.</p>
    	</subsection>

		<subsection name="2.5.3 Cleaning Stale Modeler Preferences">
    	<p>Cayenne 1.1 almost completely switched its preferences engine to use an embedded HSQL database,
		however a number of preferences are still loaded from the old preferences file. As a result a number of 
		bugs associated with the old preferences may reappear in 1.1, even though they were fixed. To clean old
		preferences shut down all running instances of CayenneModeler, then delete a file $HOME/.cayenne/modeler.preferences.
		$HOME is a user home directory which is OS and machine specific. </p>
