[An attempt to create a specifiction for documentation screenshots and other images]

   
   SCREENSHOT CREATION

   1. For consistency screenshots are taken on Mac OS X. Command-Ctrl-Shft-4 (yikes!), than select a rectangle.
   
   2. In graphic editor (Photoshop, Gimp,...) clip an area of a standard size. 
      Sizes normally used are: 500x300, 650x420. Width is more important. Height can be anything.
 
   3. Image is scaled down by factor of 1.25. So resulting image will be 400x240 or 520x336.
   
   4. Save image to a JPEG file (Gimp quality setting 0.75, Photoshop generates an OK image at 32).
