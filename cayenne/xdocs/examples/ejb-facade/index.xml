	<p>Demonstrates deploying Cayenne on JBoss server and accessing it via a SessionBean facade.
	Example project structure is based on JBoss project template.</p>
	
	<panel name="Note:">
	This is a very simple example that demonstrates how to fetch and update data via EJB facade to
	Cayenne. It omits a few things like bridging Cayenne DataObjects and Data Transfer Objects (DTO), etc.
	</panel>
	<p> </p>
	<panel name="Modeling Note:">
	 When opening cayenne.xml from this example in CayenneModeler, you will see that "Container-Managed
	 Transactions" checkbox is checked for the "Auctions" DataDomain. This setting is important to
	 prevent Cayenne from attempting explicit commit/rollback when container-managed transactions are in effect.

	<subsection name="4.1 Preparing the Environment">
	<p>The example requires running JBoss server, version 3.0 or newer. Building the example
	requires Ant and XDoclet 1.1.2.</p>
	</subsection>
	
	<subsection name="44.2 Building Example">
	<p>After installing XDoclet and starting JBoss, follow generic instructions for building examples.
	Build script will deploy all application components to the JBoss server.</p>
	</subsection>
	
	<subsection name="4.3 Running Example">
	<p>Web client can be accessed on the JBoss server via a URL like 
	<a href="http://localhost:8080/cayenne-ejbfacade/" target="_new">http://localhost:8080/cayenne-ejbfacade/</a>.
	There is also a simple command-line client that can be started from [example-folder]/build/bin .</p>
