	<p>This example demonstrates how Cayenne can be used to port relational data from one 
	database to another. It shows the operation of the few internal parts of 
	Cayenne, normally not used in the applications. DataPort also contains a working 
	Ant task, so it has practical value for certain
	database maintenance tasks. The following things come to mind:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Setting up database environment for individual developers, copying data
		from production or staging database.</li>	
		<li>Recreating predictable datasets in the test database for the purpose 
		of unit testing (e.g. there can be a reference schema created manually, and a test 
		schema that is refreshed on every test run).</li>
		<li>Porting data between databases from different vendors (i.e. a case when there is
		no vendor supported data migration tools).</li>
	</ul>
