Changes since RC2:

1. [BUGFIX for bug 673833]: Class generation templates used to create
   unneeded java.util.List imports.

2. Various documentation fixes.

3. [BUGFIX for bug 802833]: Cgen Ant task skiped class generation when
   a template was modified. Current (correct) behavior is to rerun class 
   generation in this case even when the DataMap is not modified.
   
4. [BUGFIX for bug 803355]: Import EOModel function incorrectly assumed
   java.util.Date type for EOF NSCalendarDate. This is changed to be
   java.sql.Timestamp (TIMESTAMP at the DbAttribute level)

5. Fixed ClassLoader issues that prevent correct Cayenne resource loading
   (e.g. types.xml) in some environments. Problems were reported for
   .exe application files generated by JBuilder.

6. Fixed lookup for DataSource over JNDI. There has been a problem 
   obtaining DataSource in JBoss environment. This is fixed now.  

Known Issues:

1. FireBird Adapter Issues.
 - CHAR columns may not always work in qualifiers
 - Using Stored Procedures is not tested
 - Using LOB is not tested

2. DB2 Adapter Issues.
 - Using Stored Procedures is not tested
 - Using LOB is not tested
 
3. Sybase Adapter Issues.
 - Certain inconsistencies in Sybase JDBC driver handling NULL/empty 
   LOBs may have side effects in Cayenne. See bug report 742845 for 
   details.

4. Cayenne ConnectionPool issues.

 - Long running ResultIterators may quickly deplete available connections
   in the pool.
   
   Workaround: increase the number of max. available connections for the 
   DataNode in the Modeler.

5. Renamed entities not ordered properly.

   When an Obj/DbEntity is renamed, Modeler does not re-
   order the tree view correctly in alphabetical order.
   This makes it hard to find renamed entities.
   
6. Cayenne Modeler Guide has a few unfinished chapters.
