Changes, Features And Improvements:

- cayenne-log.properties included in cayenne.jar has more sensible defaults - 
  WARN for everything except for QueryLogger.
- Removed confusing "New Project" dialog from CayenneModeler. Instead a 
  default project is created with one empty DataDomain.
- New CayenneModeler peferences mechanism based on embedded HSQLDB 
  and Cayenne as persistence engine.
- [CAY-121] CayenneModeler now allows to store a number of local DataSources 
  and map DataNodes to them for the purspose of the DB access. This is a great feature
  that simplifies team development and allows to perform DB operations even with 
  JNDI DataNodes.
- Refactored CayenneModeler to have a central Application class that provides "services"
  to components. Rewrote parts of the Modeler to use a "jstaple light" - a OGNL-based
  Swing bindings package.


Bugs Fixed:

CAY-162	Cayenne Modeler doesn't remember custom class templates
CAY-12 Prefetching on entity used in qualifier
CAY-196 DataObjectUtils.objectForPK should look in shared cache
CAY-194 Error in generating SQL query for to-one faults with inheritance


New Modeler Jar Files:

CayenneModeler now requires two more JAR files - hsqldb-1.7.2.jar and ognl-2.6.5.jar. Both are included 
in the download
