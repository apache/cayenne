Changes, Features And Improvements:

- DataObject.resolveFault() will now throw an exception if the underlying DB row does not exist
  follow this link for further discussion:
  http://objectstyle.org/cayenne/lists/cayenne-user/2004/07/0124.html
  
- Better support for custom DbAdapters in CayenneModeler. Custom DbAdapter is no longer 
  required to be in the modeler CLASSPATH. Rather CLASSPATH settings configured via 
  "Tools -> Configure ClassPath" are taken into account.
  
CAY-140	Precise "import" statements generation in default DataObject subclass template.
CAY-172	Thread-Bound DataContext Support (standalone and in web applications).
CAY-130	Supporting mapping of read/write flattened relationships in wider range of schemas,
  e.g. now Cayenne allows join tables to have their own PK and other attributes.

Bugs Fixed:

CAY-169	Import EOModel - Incorrect Join src/target names are created
CAY-2	Renamed/Added entries in the Modeler left-hand project tree are sorted correctly.
CAY-160	Improved handling of database reconnects	, fixed leaking connections bug.

... Lots of other unreported Modeler bugs.
