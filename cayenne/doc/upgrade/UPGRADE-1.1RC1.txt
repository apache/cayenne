Upgrade Information
============================================

0. Preferences Engine:

Warning: CLASSPATH settings that stored the locations of local drivers will be lost. 
Go to "Tools -> Preferences -> ClassPath" to configure them again.

General Preferences Notes:

Since RC1, CayenneModeler 1.1 uses a preferences system based on embedded 
HSQLDB. Old preferences file (~/.cayenne/modeler.preferences) is still used in a few places,
but is being gradually factored out. When switching to RC1 and newer you may lose some of your 
existing preferences (some are really minor - such as the main Window size, some may be more
important). Users are encouraged to check out "Tools -> Preferences" menu for
a new and more powerful way to configure many of the useful shortcuts.



1. General Upgrade Advise:

-  Upgrading Project XML Files: Opening a 1.0 projects in CayenneModeler would 
   display an upgrade dialog. Select "Yes" button to perform the upgrade. Note that
   upgrading a project to 1.1 will make it unusable with earlier versions of Cayenne.
   
-  Upgrading between 1.1 milestones will not display an upgrade dialog, however on
   save mapping may slightly change, as the format evolved up till Beta.

-  Clean Recompile: Cayenne 1.1 introduces a few API changes. Most of them are done 
   to the backend and should not affect the applications written with the earlier versions. 
   However it is a good idea to perform a clean compilation of all Java code that relies on 
   Cayenne. Updating calls to deprecated methods is also a very good idea.


2. General Warning:

Classes SnapshotManager, ToManyListDataSource, RelationshipDataSource, 
FlattenedRelationshipDeleteQuery, FlattenedRelationshipInsertQuery and a few others
were removed from Cayenne, since maintaining them in a deprecated state wasn't 
possible.
