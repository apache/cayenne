Upgrade Information
============================================

1.1M7 introduces the following changes in XML DTD format compared to M6: 

- cayenne-project-1_1.dtd deprecates "dep-map-ref" child of "map" element as DataMap
  explicit dependencies are no longer used.
- cayenne-data-map-1_1.dtd introduces new attribute obj-relationship.db-relationship-path
  and deprecates obj-relationship's child - "db-relationship-ref".
  
Cayenne runtime and CayenneModeler recognize "old" format, however saving the projects
is done in the new format.


!!! General Warning:

Classes SnapshotManager, ToManyListDataSource, RelationshipDataSource, 
FlattenedRelationshipDeleteQuery, FlattenedRelationshipInsertQuery and a few others
were removed from Cayenne, since maintaining them in a deprecated state wasn't 
possible.


-  Upgrading Project XML Files: Opening a 1.0 projects in CayenneModeler would 
   display an upgrade dialog. Select "Yes" button to perform the upgrade. Note that
   upgrading a project to 1.1 will make it unusable with earlier versions of Cayenne.

-  Clean Recompile: Cayenne 1.1 introduces a few API changes. Most of them are done 
   to the backend and should not affect the applications written with the earlier versions. 
   However it is a good idea to perform a clean compilation of all Java code that relies on 
   Cayenne. Updating calls to deprecated methods is a good idea as well.
