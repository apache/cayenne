Upgrade Information
============================================

0. General Upgrade Advise:

-  Upgrading Project XML Files: Opening a 1.0 projects in CayenneModeler would 
   display an upgrade dialog. Select "Yes" button to perform the upgrade. Note that
   upgrading a project to 1.1 will make it unusable with earlier versions of Cayenne.
   
-  Upgrading between 1.1 milestones will not display an upgrade dialog, however on
   save mapping may slightly change, as the format evolved up till Beta.

-  Clean Recompile: Cayenne 1.1 introduces a few API changes. Most of them are done 
   to the backend and should not affect the applications written with the earlier versions. 
   However it is a good idea to perform a clean compilation of all Java code that relies on 
   Cayenne. Updating calls to deprecated methods is also a very good idea.

1. DTD Changes:

Cayenne 1.1B1 introduces the following changes in XML DTD format compared to M7_1: 

- cayenne-data-map-1_1.dtd introduces "property" subelement of "data-map".
  
Saving any DataMap defaults will create "property" element, making *.map.xml incompatible 
with earlier releases.

2. Due to a bug fix CAY-149 it is recommended that Windows CayenneModeler users open
the file %HOME%\.cayenne\modeler.preferences in a text editor and delete all lines that
start with "Editor.lastSeveralProjectFiles=" and "Editor.lastProject=". %HOME% is usually a location
like "C:\Documents and Settings\[username]".

3. General Warning:

Classes SnapshotManager, ToManyListDataSource, RelationshipDataSource, 
FlattenedRelationshipDeleteQuery, FlattenedRelationshipInsertQuery and a few others
were removed from Cayenne, since maintaining them in a deprecated state wasn't 
possible.
