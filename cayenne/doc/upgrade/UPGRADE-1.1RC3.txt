Upgrade Information
============================================

RC3 is a drop-in replacement of RC2. If you are upgrading from an earlier release, read this notes
from RC2:

0. CAY-212 Note (displaying Japanese and Chinese chars):

To make sure that fix for CAY-212 issue takes effect on your machine follow these instructions:

- Download and install Cayenne 1.1 RC2 or newer.
- Close all Modeler instances
- Open ~/modeler.preferences file in a text editor
- Remove the line that starts with "Editor.theme=..."
- Start the Modeler - it will select "Sky Bluer" theme by default.


1. General Upgrade Advise:

-  Upgrading Project XML Files: Opening a 1.0 projects in CayenneModeler would 
   display an upgrade dialog. Select "Yes" button to perform the upgrade. Note that
   upgrading a project to 1.1 will make it unusable with earlier versions of Cayenne.
   
-  Upgrading between 1.1 milestones will not display an upgrade dialog, however on
   save mapping may slightly change, as the format evolved up till Beta.

-  Clean Recompile: Cayenne 1.1 introduces a few API changes. Most of them are done 
   to the backend and should not affect the applications written with the earlier versions. 
   However it is a good idea to perform a clean compilation of all Java code that relies on 
   Cayenne. Updating calls to deprecated methods is also a very good idea.


2. General Warning:

Classes SnapshotManager, ToManyListDataSource, RelationshipDataSource, 
FlattenedRelationshipDeleteQuery, FlattenedRelationshipInsertQuery and a few others
were removed from Cayenne, since maintaining them in a deprecated state wasn't 
possible.
