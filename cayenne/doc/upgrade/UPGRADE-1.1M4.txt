Upgrade Information
============================================

!!! Warning:

Classes SnapshotManager, ToManyListDataSource, RelationshipDataSource were removed from Cayenne,
since maintaining them in a deprecated state wasn't possible.


-  Upgrading Project XML Files: Opening a 1.0 projects in CayenneModeler would 
   display an upgrade dialog. Select "Yes" button to perform the upgrade. Note that
   upgrading a project to 1.1 will make it unusable with earlier versions of Cayenne.

-  Clean Recompile: Cayenne 1.1 introduces a few API changes. Most of them are done 
   to the backend and should not affect the applications written with the earlier versions. 
   However it is a good idea to perform a clean compilation of all Java code that relies on 
   Cayenne. Updating calls to deprecated methods is a good idea as well.
