    <title>Customizing Cayenne Runtime</title>
    <section xml:id="depdendency-injection-container">
        <title>Dependency Injection Container</title>
        <para>Cayenne runtime is built around a small powerful dependency injection (DI) container. Just
            like other popular DI technologies, such as Spring or Guice, Cayenne DI container
            manages sets of interdependent objects  and allows users to configure them. These
            objects are regular Java objects. We are calling them "services" in this document to
            distinguish from all other objects that are not configured in the container and are not
            managed. DI container is responsible for service instantiation, injecting correct
            dependencies, maintaining service instances scope, and dispatching scope events to
            services. </para>
        <para>The services are configured in special Java classes called "modules". Each module
            defines binding of service interfaces to implementation instances, implementation types
            or providers of implementation instances. There are no XML configuration files, and all
            the bindings are type-safe. The container supports injection into instance variables and
            constructor parameters based on the <code>@Inject</code> annotation. This mechanism is
            very close to Google Guice.</para>
        <para>The discussion later in this chapter demonstrates a standalone DI container. But keep in
            mind that Cayenne already has a built-in Injector, and a set of default modules. A
            Cayenne user would normally only use the API below to write custom extension modules
            that will be loaded in that existing container when creating ServerRuntime. See
            "Starting and Stopping ServerRuntime" chapter for an example of passing an extension
            module to Cayenne.</para>
        <para>Cayenne DI probably has ~80% of the features expected in a DI container and has no
            dependency on the rest of Cayenne, so in theory can be used as an application-wide DI
            engine. But it's primary purpose is still to serve Cayenne. Hence there are no plans to
            expand it beyond Cayenne needs. It is an ideal "embedded" DI that does not interfere
            with Spring, Guice or any other such framework present elsewhere in the
            application.</para>
        <section xml:id="di-bindings-api">
            <title>DI Bindings API</title>
            <para>To have a working DI container, we need three things: service interfaces and
                classes, a module that describes service bindings, a container that loads the
                module, and resolves the depedencies. Let's start with service interfaces and
                classes:<programlisting language="java">public interface Service1 {
    public String getString();
}</programlisting><programlisting language="java">public interface Service2 {
    public int getInt();
}</programlisting></para>
            <para>A service implementation using instance variable
                injection:<programlisting language="java">public class Service1Impl implements Service1 {
    @Inject
    private Service2 service2;

    public String getString() {
        return service2.getInt() + "_Service1Impl";
    }
}</programlisting>Same
                thing, but using constructor
                injection:<programlisting language="java">public class Service1Impl implements Service1 {

    private Service2 service2;

    public Service1Impl(@Inject Service2 service2) {
        this.service2 = service2;
    }

    public String getString() {
        return service2.getInt() + "_Service1Impl";
    }
}
</programlisting><programlisting language="java">public class Service2Impl implements Service2 {
    private int i;

    public int getInt() {
        return i++;
    }
}</programlisting></para>
            <para>Now let's create a module implementing
                    <code>org.apache.cayenne.tutorial.di.Module</code> interface that will contain
                DI configuration. A module binds service objects to keys that are reference. Binder
                provided by container implements fluent API to connect the key to implementation,
                and to configure various binding options (the options, such as scope, are
                demonstrated later in this chapter). The simplest form of a key is a Java Class
                object representing service interface. Here is a module that binds Service1 and
                Service2 to corresponding default implementations:</para>
            <para>
                <programlisting language="java">public class Module1 implements Module {

    public void configure(Binder binder) {
        binder.bind(Service1.class).to(Service1Impl.class);
        binder.bind(Service2.class).to(Service2Impl.class);
    }
}</programlisting>
            </para>
            <para>Once we have at least one module, we can create a DI container.
                    <code>org.apache.cayenne.di.Injector</code> is the container class in
                Cayenne:<programlisting language="java">Injector injector = DIBootstrap.createInjector(new Module1());</programlisting></para>
            <para>Now that we have created the container, we can obtain services from it and call
                their
                methods:<programlisting language="java">Service1 s1 = injector.getInstance(Service1.class);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("S1 String: " + s1.getString());
}</programlisting></para>
            <para>This outputs the following lines, demonstrating that s1 was Service1Impl and
                Service2 injected into it was
                Service2Impl:<programlisting language="java">0_Service1Impl
1_Service1Impl
2_Service1Impl
3_Service1Impl
4_Service1Impl</programlisting></para>
            <para>There are more flavors of bindings:
                <programlisting language="java">// binding to instance - allowing user to create and configure instance
// inside the module class
binder.bind(Service2.class).toInstance(new Service2Impl());

// binding to provider - delegating instance creation to a special
// provider class
binder.bind(Service1.class).toProvider(Service1Provider.class);

// binding to provider instance
binder.bind(Service1.class).toProviderInstance(new Service1Provider());

// multiple bindings of the same type using Key
// injection can reference the key name in annotation:
// @Inject("i1")
// private Service2 service2;
binder.bind(Key.get(Service2.class, "i1")).to(Service2Impl.class);
binder.bind(Key.get(Service2.class, "i2")).to(Service2Impl.class);</programlisting></para>
            <para>Another types of confiuguration that can be bound in the container are lists and
                maps. They will be discussed in the following chapters. </para>
        </section>
        <section xml:id="managing-services-lifecycle">
            <title>Service Lifecycle</title>
            <para>An important feature of the Cayenne DI container is instance <emphasis role="italic"
                    >scope</emphasis>. The default scope (implicitly used in all examples above) is
                "singleton", meaning that a binding would result in creation of only one service
                instance, that will be repeatedly returned from
                    <code>Injector.getInstance(..)</code>, as well as injected into classes that
                declare it as a dependency. </para>
            <para>Singleton scope dispatches a "BeforeScopeEnd" event to interested services. This
                event occurs before the scope is shutdown, i.e. when
                    <code>Injector.shutdown()</code> is called. Note that the built-in Cayenne
                injector is shutdown behind the scenes when <code>ServerRuntime.shutdown()</code>
                is invoked. Services may register as listeners for this event by annotating a
                no-argument method with <code>@BeforeScopeEnd</code> annotation. Such method should
                be implemented if a service needs to clean up some resources, stop threads,
                etc.</para>
            <para>Another useful scope is "no scope", meaning that every time a container is asked to provide
                a service instance for a given key, a new instance will be created and
                returned:<programlisting language="java">binder.bind(Service2.class).to(Service2Impl.class).withoutScope();</programlisting>Users
                can also create their own scopes, e.g. a web application request scope or a session
                scope. Most often than not custom scopes can be created as instances of
                    <code>org.apache.cayenne.di.spi.DefaultScope</code> with startup and shutdown
                managed by the application (e.g. singleton scope is a DefaultScope managed by the
                Injector) . </para>
        </section>
        <section xml:id="overriding-services">
            <title>Overriding Services</title>
            <para>Cayenne DI allows to override services already definied in the current module, or
                more commonly - some other module in the the same container. Actually there's no
                special API to override a service, you'd just bind the service key again with a new
                implementation or provider. The last binding for a key takes precedence. This means
                that the order of modules is important when configuring a container. The built-in
                Cayenne injector ensures that Cayenne standard modules are loaded first, followed by
                optional user extension modules. This way the application can override the standard
                services in Cayenne.</para>

    </section>
    <section xml:id="ways-to-customize-runtime">
        <title> Customization Strategies</title>
        <para>The previous section discussed how Cayenne DI works in general terms. Since Cayenne users
            will mostly be dealing with an existing Injector provided by ServerRuntime, it is
            important to understand how to build custom extensions to a preconfigured container. As
            shown in "Starting and Stopping ServerRuntime" chapter, custom extensions are done by
            writing an aplication DI module (or multiple modules) that configures service overrides.
            This section shows all the configuration possibilities in detail, including changing
            properties of the existing services, contributing services to standard service lists and
            maps, and overriding service implementations. All the code examples later in this
            section are assumed to be placed in an application module "configure" method:</para><programlisting language="java">public class MyExtensionsModule implements Module {
    public void configure(Binder binder) {
        // customizations go here...
    }
}</programlisting><programlisting language="java">Module extensions = new MyExtensionsModule();
ServerRuntime runtime = ServerRuntime.builder()
        .addConfig("com/example/cayenne-mydomain.xml")
        .addModule(extensions)
        .build();</programlisting>
        <section xml:id="changing-properties-of-existing-services">
            <title>Changing Properties of Existing Services</title>
            <para>Many built-in Cayenne services change their behavior based on a value of some
                environment property. A user may change Cayenne behavior without even knowing which
                services are responsible for it, but setting a specific value of a known property.
                Supported property names are listed in "Appendix A".</para>
            <para>There are two ways to set service properties. The most obvious one is to pass it
                to the JVM with -D flag on startup.
                E.g.<screen><prompt>$</prompt> java -Dcayenne.server.contexts_sync_strategy=false ...</screen></para>
            <para>A second one is to contribute a property to
                    <code>org.apache.cayenne.configuration.DefaultRuntimeProperties.properties
                </code>map (see the next section on how to do that). This map contains the default
                property values and can accept application-specific values, overrding the defaults. </para>
            <para>Note that if a property value is a name of a Java class, when this Java class is
                instantiated by Cayenne, the container performs injection of instance variables. So
                even the dynamically specified Java classes can use @Inject annotation to get a hold
                of other Cayenne services.</para>
            <para>If the same property is specified both in the command line and in the properties
                map, the command-line value takes precedence. The map value will be ignored. This
                way Cayenne runtime can be reconfigured during deployment.</para>
        </section>
        <section xml:id="contributing-to-service-lists-maps">
            <title>Contributing to Service Collections</title>
            <para>Cayenne can be extended by adding custom objects to named maps or lists bound in
                DI. We are calling these lists/maps "service collections". A service collection
                allows things like appending a custom strategy to a list of built-in strategies.
                E.g. an application that needs to install a custom DbAdapter for some database type
                may contribute an instance of custom DbAdapterDetector to a
                    <code>org.apache.cayenne.configuration.server.DefaultDbAdapterFactory.detectors</code>
                list:</para>
            <programlisting language="java">public class MyDbAdapterDetector implements DbAdapterDetector {
    public DbAdapter createAdapter(DatabaseMetaData md) throws SQLException {
        // check if we support this database and retun custom adapter
        ...
    }
}</programlisting>
            <programlisting language="java">// since build-in list for this key is a singleton, repeated
// calls to 'bindList' will return the same instance 
binder.bindList(DefaultDbAdapterFactory.DETECTORS_LIST)
       .add(MyDbAdapterDetector.class);</programlisting>
            <para>Maps are customized using a similar "<code>bindMap</code>" method.</para>
            <para>The names of built-in collections are listed in "Appendix B".</para>
        </section>
        <section xml:id="alternative-service-implementations">
            <title>Alternative Service Implementations</title>
            <para>As mentioned above, custom modules are loaded by ServerRuntime after the built-in
                modules. So it is easy to redefine a built-in service in Cayenne by rebinding
                desired implementations or providers. To do that, first we need to know what those
                services to redefine are. While we describe some of them in the following sections,
                the best way to get a full list is to check the source code of the Cayenne version
                you are using and namely look in
                    <code>org.apache.cayenne.configuration.server.ServerModule</code> - the main
                built-in module in Cayenne. </para>
            <para>Now an example of overriding <code>QueryCache</code> service. The default
                implementation of this service is provided by <code>MapQueryCacheProvider</code>.
                But if we want to use <code>EhCacheQueryCache</code> (a Cayenne wrapper for the
                EhCache framework), we can define it like
                this:<programlisting language="java">binder.bind(QueryCache.class).to(EhCacheQueryCache.class);</programlisting></para>

        <title>Using custom data types</title>
        <section>
            <title>Value object type</title>
            <para>
                <code>ValueObjectType</code> is a new and lightweight alternative to the Extended Types API described in the following section.
                In most cases is should be preferred as is it easier to understand and use. Currently only one case is known when <code>ExtendedType</code> should be used:
                when your value object can be mapped on different JDBC types.
            </para>
            <para>
                In order to use your custom data type you should implement <code>ValueObjectType</code> describing it in terms of some type already known to Cayenne
                (e.g. backed by system or user ExtendedType).
                Let's assume we want to support some data type called <code>Money</code>:
                <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public class Money {
    private BigDecimal value;

    public Money(BigDecimal value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    public BigDecimal getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    // .. some other business logic ..
}]]></programlisting>
                Here is how <code>ValueObjectType</code> that will allow to store our <code>Money</code> class as <code>BigDecimal</code>
                can be implemented:
                <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public class MoneyValueObjectType implements ValueObjectType<Money, BigDecimal> {

    @Override
    public Class<BigDecimal> getTargetType() {
        return BigDecimal.class;
    }

    @Override
    public Class<Money> getValueType() {
        return Money.class;
    }

    @Override
    public Money toJavaObject(BigDecimal value) {
        return new Money(value);
    }

    @Override
    public BigDecimal fromJavaObject(Money object) {
        return object.getValue();
    }

    @Override
    public String toCacheKey(Money object) {
        return object.getValue().toString();
    }
}]]></programlisting>
            </para>
            <para>
                Last step is to register this new type in <code>ServerRuntime</code>:
                <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[ServerRuntime runtime = ServerRuntime.builder()
    .addConfig("cayenne-project.xml")
    .addModule(binder -> ServerModule.contributeValueObjectTypes(binder).add(MoneyValueObjectType.class))
    .build();]]></programlisting>
            </para>

            <title>Extended Types</title>
            <para>JDBC specification defines a set of "standard" database column types (defined in java.sql.Types class)
                and a very specific mapping of these types to Java Object Types, such as java.lang.String,
                java.math.BigDecimal, etc. Sometimes there is a need to use a custom Java type not known to JDBC driver and
                Cayenne allows to configure it. For this Cayenne needs to know how to instantiate this type from
                a database "primitive" value, and conversely, how to transform an object of the custom type to
                a JDBC-compatible object.</para>
            <section xml:id="supporting-non-standard-types">
                <title>Supporting Non-Standard Types</title>
                <para>For supporting non-standard type you should define it via an interface <code>org.apache.cayenne.access.types.ExtendedType</code>.
                    An implementation must provide <code>ExtendedType.getClassName()</code> method that returns

                    that convert data between JDBC and custom type.
                    The following example demonstrates how to add a custom DoubleArrayType

                <title>DbAdapters and Extended Types</title>
                <para>As shown in the example above, ExtendedTypes are stored by DbAdapter. In fact DbAdapters often install
                    their own extended types to address incompatibilities, incompleteness and differences between
                    JDBC drivers in handling "standard" JDBC types. For instance some drivers support reading large
                    character columns (CLOB) as java.sql.Clob, but some other - as "character stream", etc.
                    Adapters provided with Cayenne override <code>configureExtendedTypes()</code> method to install their own types,
                    possibly substituting Cayenne defaults. Custom DbAdapters can use the same technique.</para>

            <para><code>org.apache.cayenne.log.JdbcEventLogger</code> is the service that defines
                logging API for Cayenne internals. It provides facilities for logging queries,
                commits, transactions, etc. The default implementation is
                    <code>org.apache.cayenne.log.Slf4jJdbcEventLogger</code> that performs logging
                via slf4j-api library. Cayenne library includes another potentially useful
                logger - <code>org.apache.cayenne.log.FormattedSlf4jJdbcEventLogger</code> that
                produces formatted multiline SQL output that can be easier to read.</para>
