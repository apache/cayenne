    <title>Queries</title>
    <para>Queries are Java objects used by the application to communicate with the database. Cayenne
        knows how to translate queries into SQL statements appropriate for a particular database
        engine. Most often queries are used to find objects matching certain criteria, but there are
        other types of queries too. E.g. those allowing to run native SQL, call DB stored
        procedures, etc. When committing objects, Cayenne itself creates special queries to
        insert/update/delete rows in the database. </para>
    <para>There is a number of built-in queries in Cayenne, described later in this chapter. Most of
        the newer queries use fluent API and can be created and executed as easy-to-read one-liners.
        Users can define their own query types to abstract certain DB interactions that for whatever
        reason can not be adequately described by the built-in set.</para>
    <para>Queries can be roughly categorized as "object" and "native". Object queries (most notably
        ObjectSelect, SelectById, and EJBQLQuery) are built with abstractions originating in the
        object model (the "object" side in the "object-relational" divide). E.g. ObjectSelect is
        assembled from a Java class of the objects to fetch, a qualifier expression, orderings, etc.
        - all of this expressed in terms of the object model.</para>
    <para>Native queries describe a desired DB operation as SQL code (SQLSelect, SQLTemplate query)
        or a reference to a stored procedure (ProcedureQuery), etc. The results of native queries
        are usually presented as Lists of Maps, with each map representing a row in the DB (a term
        "data row" is often used to describe such a map). They can potentially be converted to
        objects, however it may take a considerable effort to do so. Native queries are also less
        (if at all) portable across databases than object queries. </para>
    <section xml:id="selectquery">
        <title>ObjectSelect</title>
        <para>
            <emphasis role="italic">ObjectSelect supersedes older SelectQuery. SelectQuery is still
                available and supported. </emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>ObjectSelect is the most commonly used query in Cayenne applications. This may be the
            only query you will ever need. It returns a list of persistent objects (or data rows) of
            a certain type specified in the
            query:<programlisting language="java">List&lt;Artist> objects = ObjectSelect.query(Artist.class).select(context);</programlisting>This
            returned all rows in the "ARTIST" table. If the logs were turned on, you might see the
            following SQL
            printed:<screen>INFO: SELECT t0.DATE_OF_BIRTH, t0.NAME, t0.ID FROM ARTIST t0
INFO: === returned 5 row. - took 5 ms.</screen></para>
        <para>This SQL was generated by Cayenne from the ObjectSelect above. ObjectSelect can have a
            qualifier to select only the data matching specific criteria. Qualifier is simply an
            Expression (Expressions where discussed in the previous chapter), appended to the query
            using "where" method. If you only want artists whose name begins with 'Pablo', you might
            use the following qualifier expression:
            <programlisting language="java">List&lt;Artist> objects = ObjectSelect.query(Artist.class)
        .where(Artist.NAME.like("Pablo%"))
        .select(context);</programlisting>The
            SQL will look different this
            time:<screen>INFO: SELECT t0.DATE_OF_BIRTH, t0.NAME, t0.ID FROM ARTIST t0 WHERE t0.NAME LIKE ?
[bind: 1->NAME:'Pablo%']
INFO: === returned 1 row. - took 6 ms.</screen></para>
        <para>ObjectSelect allows to assemble qualifier from parts, using "and" and "or" method to
            chain then
            together:<programlisting language="java">List&lt;Artist> objects = ObjectSelect.query(Artist.class)
        .where(Artist.NAME.like("A%"))
        .and(Artist.DATE_OF_BIRTH.gt(someDate)
        .select(context);</programlisting></para>
        <para>To order the results of ObjectSelect, one or more orderings can be
            applied:<programlisting language="java">List&lt;Artist> objects = ObjectSelect.query(Artist.class)
        .addOrderBy(Artist.DATE_OF_BIRTH.desc())
        .addOrderBy(Artist.NAME.asc())
        .select(context);</programlisting></para>
        <para>There's a number of other useful methods in ObjectSelect that define what to select
            and how to optimize database interaction (prefetching, caching, fetch offset and limit,
            pagination, etc.). Some of them are discussed in separate chapters on caching and
            performance optimization. Others are fairly self-explanatory. Please check the API docs
            for the full extent of the ObjectSelect features.</para>

    <section xml:id="ejbqlquery">
        <title>EJBQLQuery</title>
        <para>EJBQLQuery was created as a part of an experiment in adopting some of Java Persistence
            API (JPA) approaches in Cayenne. It is a parameterized object query that is created from
            query String. A String used to build EJBQLQuery must conform to JPQL (JPA query
            language):<programlisting language="java">EJBQLQuery query = new EJBQLQuery("select a FROM Artist a");</programlisting></para>
        <para>JPQL details can be found in any JPA manual. Here we'll mention only how this fits
            into Cayenne and what are the differences between EJBQL and other Cayenne
            queries.</para>
        <para>Although most frequently EJBQLQuery is used as an alternative to SelectQuery, there
            are also DELETE and UPDATE varieties available. <note>
                <para>As of this version of Cayenne, DELETE and UPDATE do not change the state of
                    objects in the ObjectContext. They are run directly against the database
                    instead. </para>
            </note><programlisting language="java">EJBQLQuery select = new EJBQLQuery("select a FROM Artist a WHERE a.name = 'Salvador Dali'");
List&lt;Artist> artists = context.performQuery(select);</programlisting><programlisting language="java">EJBQLQuery delete = new EJBQLQuery("delete from Painting");
context.performGenericQuery(delete);</programlisting><programlisting language="java">EJBQLQuery update = new EJBQLQuery("UPDATE Painting AS p SET p.name = 'P2' WHERE p.name = 'P1'");
context.performGenericQuery(update);</programlisting>In
            most cases SelectQuery is preferred to EJBQLQuery, as it is API-based, and provides you
            with better compile-time checks. However sometimes you may want a completely scriptable
            object query. This is when you might prefer EJBQL. A more practical reason for picking
            EJBQL over SelectQuery though is that the former offers some extra selecting
            capabilities, namely aggregate functions and
            subqueries:<programlisting language="java">EJBQLQuery query = new EJBQLQuery("select a, COUNT(p) FROM Artist a JOIN a.paintings p GROUP BY a");
List&lt;Object[]> result = context.performQuery(query);
for(Object[] artistWithCount : result) {
    Artist a = (Artist) artistWithCount[0];
    int hasPaintings = (Integer) artistWithCount[1];
}</programlisting>This
            also demonstrates a previously unseen type of select result - a List of Object[]
            elements, where each entry in an Object[] is either a DataObject or a scalar, depending
            on the query SELECT clause. A result can also be a list of
            scalars:<programlisting language="java">EJBQLQuery query = new EJBQLQuery("select a.name FROM Artist a");
List&lt;String> names = context.performQuery(query);</programlisting>

            EJBQLQuery supports an "IN" clause with three different usage-patterns.  The following
            example would require three individual positional parameters (named
            parameters could also have been used) to be supplied.

            <programlisting language="sql">select p from Painting p where p.paintingTitle in (?1,?2,?3)</programlisting>

            The following example requires a single positional parameter to be supplied.  The
            parameter can be any concrete implementation of the java.util.Collection interface such as
            java.util.List or java.util.Set.

            <programlisting language="sql">select p from Painting p where p.paintingTitle in ?1</programlisting>

            The following example is functionally identical to the one prior.

            <programlisting language="sql">select p from Painting p where p.paintingTitle in (?1)</programlisting>

            </para>
            <para>

            While
            Cayenne Expressions discussed previously can be thought of as identical to JPQL WHERE
            clause, and indeed they are very close, there are a few noteable differences:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Null handling: SelectQuery would translate the expressions matching NULL
                        values to the corresponding "X IS NULL" or "X IS NOT NULL" SQL syntax.
                        EJBQLQuery on the other hand requires explicit "IS NULL" (or "IS NOT NULL")
                        syntax to be used, otherwise the generated SQL will look like "X = NULL" (or
                        "X &lt;> NULL"), which will evaluate differently.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Expression Parameters: SelectQuery uses "$" to denote named parameters
                        (e.g. "$myParam"), while EJBQL uses ":" (e.g. ":myParam"). Also EJBQL
                        supports positional parameters denoted by the question mark: "?3".</para>

    <section xml:id="sqltemplate">
        <title>SQLTemplate</title>
        <para>SQLTemplate is a query that allows to run native SQL from a Cayenne application. It
            comes handy when the standard ORM concepts are not sufficient for a given query or an
            update. SQL is too powerful and allows to manipulate data in ways that are not easily
            described as a graph of related entities. Cayenne acknowledges this fact and provides
            this facility to execute SQL, mapping the result to objects when possible. Here are
            examples of selecting and non-selecting
            SQLTemplates:<programlisting language="java">SQLTemplate select = new SQLTemplate(Artist.class, "select * from ARTIST"); 
List&lt;Artist> result = context.performQuery(select);</programlisting><programlisting language="java">SQLTemplate update = new SQLTemplate(Artist.class, "delete from ARTIST");
QueryResponse response = context.performGenericQuery(update);</programlisting></para>
        <para>Cayenne doesn't make any attempt to make sense of the SQL semantics, so it doesn't
            know whether a given query is performing a select or update, etc. It is the the user's
            decision to run a given query as a selecting or "generic".</para>
        <para>
            <note>
                <para>Any data modifications done to DB as a result of SQLTemplate execution do not
                    change the state of objects in the ObjectContext. So some objects in the context
                    may become stale as a result.</para>
            </note>
        </para>
        <para>Another point to note is that the first argument to the SQLTemplate constructor - the
            Java class - has the same meaning as in SelectQuery only when the result can be
            converted to objects (e.g. when this is a selecting query and it is selecting all
            columns from one table). In this case it denotes the "root" entity of this query result.
            If the query does not denote a single entity result, this argument is only used for
            query routing, i.e. determining which database it should be run against. You are free to
            use any persistent class or even a DataMap instance in such situation. It will work as
            long as the passed "root" maps to the same database as the current query.</para>
        <para>To achieve interoperability between mutliple RDBMS a user can specify multiple SQL
            statements for the same SQLTemplate, each corresponding to a native SQL dialect. A key
            used to look up the right dialect during execution is a fully qualified class name of
            the corresponding DbAdapter. If no DB-specific statement is present for a given DB, a
            default generic statement is used. E.g. in all the examples above a default statement
            will be used regardless of the runtime database. So in most cases you won't need to
            explicitly "translate" your SQL to all possible dialects. Here is how this works in
            practice:<programlisting language="java">SQLTemplate select = new SQLTemplate(Artist.class, "select * from ARTIST"); 

// For Postgres it would be nice to trim padding of all CHAR columns.
// Otherwise those will be returned with whitespace on the right.
// assuming "NAME" is defined as CHAR...
String pgSQL = "SELECT ARTIST_ID, RTRIM(NAME), DATE_OF_BIRTH FROM ARTIST";
query.setTemplate(PostgresAdapter.class.getName(), pgSQL);</programlisting></para>
        
        <section xml:id="sqltemplate-scripting">
            <title>Scripting SQLTemplate with Velocity</title>
            <para>The most interesting aspect of SQLTemplate (and the reason why it is called a
                "template") is that a SQL string is treated by Cayenne as an Apache Velocity
                template. Before sending it to DB as a PreparedStatement, the String is evaluated in
                the Velocity context, that does variable substitutions, and performs special
                callbacks in response to various directives, thus controlling query interaction with
                the JDBC layer. </para>
            <para>Check Velocity docs for the syntax details. Here we'll just mention the two main
                scripting elements - "variables" (that look like <code>$var</code>) and "directives"
                (that look like <code>#directive(p1 p2 p3)</code>). All built-in Velocity directives
                are supported. Additionally Cayenne defines a number of its own directives to bind
                parameters to PreparedStatements and to control the structure of the ResultSet.
                These directives are described in the following sections.</para>

        <section xml:id="sqltemplate-parameters">
            <title>Variable Substitution</title>
            <para>All variables in the template string are replaced from query
                parameters:<programlisting language="java">SQLTemplate query = new SQLTemplate(Artist.class, "delete from $tableName");
query.setParameters(Collections.singletonMap("tableName", "mydb.PAINTING"));

// this will generate SQL like this: "delete from mydb.PAINTING"</programlisting>The
                example above demonstrates the point made earlier in this chapter - even if we don't
                know upfront which table the query will run against, we can still use a fixed "root"
                in constructor (<code>Artist.class</code> in this case) , as we are not planning on
                converting the result to objects.</para>
            <para>Variable substitution within the text uses "<code>object.toString()</code>" method to replace the
                variable value. Keep in mind that this may not be appropriate in all situations.
                E.g. passing a date object in a WHERE clause expression may be converted to a String
                not understood by the target RDBMS SQL parser. In such cases variable should be wrapped in <code>#bind</code>
                directive as described below.</para>

                    such places it almost always makes sense to pass objects to the template via

                <para>It can be tricky to use a Persistent object or an ObjectId in a binding,
                    especially for tables with compound primary keys. This directive helps to handle
                    such binding. It maps columns in the query to the names of Persistent object ID
                    columns, extracts ID values from the object, and generates SQL like "COL1 = ?
                    AND COL2 = ? ..." , binding positional parameters to ID values. It can also
                    correctly handle null object. Also notice how we are specifying a Velocity array
                    for multi-column PK.</para>

                    conditional inclusion of SQL code. They are used together with
                        <code>#chain</code> wrapping multiple <code>#chunks</code>. A chunk
                    evaluates its parameter expression and if it is NULL suppresses rendering of the

                    allows to work with otherwise hard to script SQL semantics. E.g. a WHERE clause
                    can contain multiple conditions joined with AND or OR. Application code would
                    like to exclude a condition if its right-hand parameter is not present (similar
                    to Expression pruning discussed above). If all conditions are excluded, the
                    entire WHERE clause should be excluded. chain/chunk allows to do that.</para>

            <title>Mapping SQLTemplate Results</title>
            <para>Here we'll discuss how to convert the data selected via SQLTemplate to some
                useable format, compatible with other query results. It can either be very simple or
                very complex, depending on the structure of the SQL, JDBC driver nature and the
                desired result structure. This section presents various tips and tricks dealing with
                result mapping. </para>
            <para>By default SQLTemplate is expected to return a List of Persistent objects of its
                root type. This is the simple
                case:<programlisting language="java">SQLTemplate query = new SQLTemplate(Artist.class, "SELECT * FROM ARTIST");

// List of Artists
List&lt;Artist> artists = context.performQuery(query);</programlisting>Just
                like SelectQuery, SQLTemplate can fetch DataRows. In fact DataRows option is very
                useful with SQLTemplate, as the result type most often than not does not represent a
                Cayenne entity, but instead may be some aggregated report or any other data whose
                object structure is opaque to
                Cayenne:<programlisting language="java">String sql = "SELECT t0.NAME, COUNT(1) FROM ARTIST t0 JOIN PAINTING t1 ON (t0.ID = t1.ARTIST_ID) "
    + "GROUP BY t0.NAME ORDER BY COUNT(1)";
SQLTemplate query = new SQLTemplate(Artist.class, sql);

// ensure we are fetching DataRows
query.setFetchingDataRows(true);

// List of DataRow
List&lt;DataRow> rows = context.performQuery(query);</programlisting>In
                the example above, even though the query root is Artist. the result is a list of
                artist names with painting counts (as mentioned before in such case "root" is only
                used to find the DB to fetch against, but has no bearning on the result). The
                DataRows here are the most appropriate and desired result type.</para>
            <para>In a more advanced case you may decide to fetch a list of scalars or a list of
                Object[] with each array entry being either an entity or a scalar. You probably
                won't be doing this too often and it requires quite a lot of work to setup, but if
                you want your SQLTemplate to return results similar to EJBQLQuery, it is doable
                using SQLResult as described
                below:<programlisting language="java">SQLTemplate query = new SQLTemplate(Painting.class, "SELECT ESTIMATED_PRICE P FROM PAINTING");

// let Cayenne know that result is a scalar
SQLResult resultDescriptor = new SQLResult();
resultDescriptor.addColumnResult("P");
query.setResult(resultDescriptor);

// List of BigDecimals
List&lt;BigDecimal> prices = context.performQuery(query); </programlisting><programlisting language="java">SQLTemplate query = new SQLTemplate(Artist.class, "SELECT t0.ID, t0.NAME, t0.DATE_OF_BIRTH, COUNT(t1.PAINTING_ID) C " +
      "FROM ARTIST t0 LEFT JOIN PAINTING t1 ON (t0.ID = t1.ARTIST_ID) " +
      "GROUP BY t0.ID, t0.NAME, t0.DATE_OF_BIRTH");

// let Cayenne know that result is a mix of Artist objects and the count of their paintings
EntityResult artistResult = new EntityResult(Artist.class);
artistResult.addDbField(Artist.ID_PK_COLUMN, "ARTIST_ID");
artistResult.addObjectField(Artist.NAME_PROPERTY, "NAME");
artistResult.addObjectField(Artist.DATE_OF_BIRTH_PROPERTY, "DATE_OF_BIRTH");

SQLResult resultDescriptor = new SQLResult();
resultDescriptor.addEntityResult(artistResult);
resultDescriptor.addColumnResult("C");
query.setResult(resultDescriptor);

// List of Object[]
List&lt;Object[]> data = context.performQuery(query);</programlisting></para>
            <para>Another trick related to mapping result sets is making Cayenne recognize
                prefetched entities in the result set. This emulates "joint" prefetching of
                SelectQuery, and is achieved by special column naming. Columns belonging to the
                "root" entity of the query should use unqualified names corresponding to the root
                DbEntity columns. For each related entity column names must be prefixed with
                relationship name and a dot (e.g. "toArtist.ID"). Column naming can be controlled
                with "#result"
                directive:<programlisting language="java">String sql = "SELECT distinct "
    + "#result('t1.ESTIMATED_PRICE' 'BigDecimal' '' 'paintings.ESTIMATED_PRICE'), "
    + "#result('t1.PAINTING_TITLE' 'String' '' 'paintings.PAINTING_TITLE'), "
    + "#result('t1.GALLERY_ID' 'int' '' 'paintings.GALLERY_ID'), "
    + "#result('t1.ID' 'int' '' 'paintings.ID'), "
    + "#result('NAME' 'String'), "
    + "#result('DATE_OF_BIRTH' 'java.util.Date'), "
    + "#result('t0.ID' 'int' '' 'ID') "
    + "FROM ARTIST t0, PAINTING t1 "
    + "WHERE t0.ID = t1.ARTIST_ID";

SQLTemplate q = new SQLTemplate(Artist.class, sql);
q.addPrefetch(Artist.PAINTINGS_PROPERTY)
List&lt;Artist> objects = context.performQuery(query);</programlisting></para>
            <para>And the final tip deals with capitalization of the DataRow keys. Queries like
                    "<code>SELECT * FROM...</code>" and even "<code>SELECT COLUMN1, COLUMN2, ...
                    FROM ...</code>" can sometimes result in Cayenne exceptions on attempts to
                convert fetched DataRows to objects. Essentially any query that is not using a
                    <code>#result</code> directive to describe the result set is prone to this
                problem, as different databases may produce different capitalization of the
                java.sql.ResultSet columns. </para>
            <para>The most universal way to address this issue is to describe each column explicitly
                in the SQLTemplate via <code>#result</code>, e.g.: "<code>SELECT #result('column1'),
                    #result('column2'), ..</code>". However this quickly becomes impractical for
                tables with lots of columns. For such cases Cayenne provides a shortcut based on the
                fact that an ORM mapping usually follows some naming convention for the column
                names. Simply put, for case-insensitive databases developers normally use either all
                lowercase or all uppercase column names. Here is the API that takes advantage of
                that user knowledge and forces Cayenne to follow a given naming convention for the
                DataRow keys (this is also available as a dropdown in the
                Modeler):<programlisting language="java">SQLTemplate query = new SQLTemplate("SELECT * FROM ARTIST");
query.setColumnNamesCapitalization(CapsStrategy.LOWER);
List objects = context.performQuery(query);</programlisting></para>
            <para>or<programlisting language="java">SQLTemplate query = new SQLTemplate("SELECT * FROM ARTIST");
query.setColumnNamesCapitalization(CapsStrategy.UPPER);
List objects = context.performQuery(query); </programlisting></para>
            <para>None of this affects the generated SQL, but the resulting DataRows are using
                correct capitalization. Note that you probably shouldn't bother with this unless you
                are getting CayenneRuntimeExceptions when fetching with SQLTemplate.</para>

    <section xml:id="procedurequery">
        <title>ProcedureQuery</title>
        <para>Stored procedures are mapped as separate objects in CayenneModeler. ProcedureQuery
            provides a way to execute them with a certain set of parameters. Just like with
            SQLTemplate, the outcome of a procedure can be anything - a single result set, mutliple
            result sets, some data modification (returned as an update count), or a combination of
            these. So use "performQuery" to get a single result set, and use "performGenericQuery"
            for anything
            else:<programlisting language="java">ProcedureQuery query = new ProcedureQuery("my_procedure", Artist.class);

            parameters. To simplify the processing of the query output, QueryResponse treats OUT
            parameters as if it was a separate result set. If a stored procedure declares any OUT or
            INOUT parameters, QueryResponse will contain their returned values in the very first

            explicitly wrapped in an "external" Transaction. This is one of the few cases when a

        <para>E.g. to do something directly in the JDBC layer, you might subclass
            AbstractQuery:<programlisting language="java">public class MyQuery extends AbstractQuery {

    @Override
    public SQLAction createSQLAction(SQLActionVisitor visitor) {
        return new SQLAction() {

            @Override
            public void performAction(Connection connection, OperationObserver observer) throws SQLException, Exception {
                // 1. do some JDBC work using provided connection... 
                // 2. push results back to Cayenne via OperationObserver
            }
        };
    }
}</programlisting></para>
        <para>To delegate the actual query execution to a standard Cayenne query, you may subclass
            IndirectQuery:<programlisting language="java">public class MyDelegatingQuery extends IndirectQuery {
    
    @Override
    protected Query createReplacementQuery(EntityResolver resolver) {
        SQLTemplate delegate = new SQLTemplate(SomeClass.class, generateRawSQL());
        delegate.setFetchingDataRows(true);
        return delegate;
    }
    
    protected String generateRawSQL() {
        // build some SQL string
    }
}</programlisting></para>
        <para>In fact many internal Cayenne queries are IndirectQueries, delegating to SelectQuery
            or SQLTemplate after some preprocessing.</para>
