[[_getting_started_db_first_part1_prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites


You can start with this tutorial, or you can do "Getting Started with Cayenne" first and then continue with this tutorial.

This chapter lists the recommended software used in the tutorial.

[[_install_java]]
==== Java


Cayenne 4.0 requires JDK 1.7 or newer.

[[_install_idea]]
==== IntelliJ IDEA IDE


Download and install the free IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition IDE.
This tutorial uses version 2017.1, but any recent IntelliJ IDEA version and edition will do. 

[[_install_maven]]
==== Maven


Two Maven plugins are used:

* *cayenne-maven-plugin* - among other things, allows to reverse-engineer the Cayenne model from the database and to update the model after the database has been changed.
* *cayenne-modeler-maven-plugin* - provides a convenient way of starting the Cayenne Modeler


[[_install_mysql]]
==== MySQL


MySQL database server is used for demonstrating Cayenne's ability to read the DB schema and to build/update the Cayenne model from it.

You can create test database with any tools you comfortable with, here is full DB schema that will be used in this tutorial: 
[source,sql]
----
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS cayenne_demo; USE cayenne_demo;
CREATE TABLE ARTIST (DATE_OF_BIRTH DATE NULL, ID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, NAME VARCHAR(200) NULL, PRIMARY KEY (ID)) ENGINE=InnoDB;
CREATE TABLE GALLERY (ID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, NAME VARCHAR(200) NULL, PRIMARY KEY (ID)) ENGINE=InnoDB;
CREATE TABLE PAINTING (ARTIST_ID INT NULL, GALLERY_ID INT NULL, ID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, NAME VARCHAR(200) NULL, PRIMARY KEY (ID)) ENGINE=InnoDB;
ALTER TABLE PAINTING ADD FOREIGN KEY (ARTIST_ID) REFERENCES ARTIST (ID) ON DELETE CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE PAINTING ADD FOREIGN KEY (GALLERY_ID) REFERENCES GALLERY (ID) ON DELETE CASCADE;
----

You can save it to `cayenne_demo.sql` file and import to your database with following command: 
----
$ mysql < cayenne_demo.sql
----
