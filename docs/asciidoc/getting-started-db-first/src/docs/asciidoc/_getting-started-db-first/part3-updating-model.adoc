=== Updating model


We now have everything we need, let's try some more features of plugin. 

==== Update DDL


To show next feature let's imagine that over some time our database schema has evolved and we need to synchronize it with our model, no problem we can simply run `cdbimport` again and all changes will be loaded to model.
We use following SQL script to alter our demo database: 
[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE cayenne_demo.PAINTING_INFO (INFO VARCHAR(255) NULL, PAINTING_ID INT NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (PAINTING_ID)) ENGINE=InnoDB;
ALTER TABLE cayenne_demo.GALLERY ADD COLUMN FOUNDED_DATE DATE;
ALTER TABLE cayenne_demo.PAINTING_INFO ADD FOREIGN KEY (PAINTING_ID) REFERENCES cayenne_demo.PAINTING (ID);
----

==== Run cdbimport


Now we can simply run again 
----
$ mvn cayenne:cdbimport
----

You should see output similar to this: 
----
...
[INFO]   Table: cayenne_demo.ARTIST
[INFO]   Table: cayenne_demo.GALLERY
[INFO]   Table: cayenne_demo.PAINTING
[INFO]   Table: cayenne_demo.PAINTING_INFO
[INFO]     Db Relationship : toOne  (PAINTING_INFO.PAINTING_ID, PAINTING.ID)
[INFO]     Db Relationship : toOne  (PAINTING.ID, PAINTING_INFO.PAINTING_ID)
[INFO]     Db Relationship : toOne  (PAINTING.GALLERY_ID, GALLERY.ID)
[INFO]     Db Relationship : toMany (GALLERY.ID, PAINTING.GALLERY_ID)
[INFO]     Db Relationship : toOne  (PAINTING.ARTIST_ID, ARTIST.ID)
[INFO]     Db Relationship : toMany (ARTIST.ID, PAINTING.ARTIST_ID)
[INFO]
[INFO] Detected changes:
[INFO]     Create Table         PAINTING_INFO
[INFO]     Add Column           GALLERY.FOUNDED_DATE
[INFO]     Add Relationship     paintingInfo PAINTING->PAINTING_INFO.PAINTING_ID
[INFO]
[INFO] Migration Complete Successfully.
----

Let's run Modeler and check that all changes are present in our model: 
----
$ mvn cayenne-modeler:run
----

Great! New table and ObjEntity are in place, as well as a new field.

==== Customizing Model


There is often a need to customize model to better fit it to your application requirements, such customization can be simple removal of toMany part of a relationship between two objects.
Let's do it, in a Modeler just select and remove relationship `paintings` in Artist object:

Now if you run 
----
$ mvn cayenne:cdbimport
----

it still find nothing to do: 
----
...
[INFO] Detected changes: No changes to import.
----

[NOTE]
====
`cdbimport` will skip only modifications in Object layer (e.g.
ObjEntities, ObjAttributes and ObjRelationships), if you modify Db layer your changes will be overridden by next run of ``cdbimport``.
