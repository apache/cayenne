=== Generating Java classes

Now as we have our model ready let's generate Java code that actually will be used in application.
In order to do that we'll use same maven plugin, but different goal, namely ``cgen``.
It has many options to configure but default values will do for our case, so we can just call it:
----
$ mvn cayenne:cgen
----

You should see output telling that everything is done, like this: 
----

In IDEA you should be able to see these newly generated classes:

Note that Cayenne code is unrecognized, that's because we need to include Cayenne as dependency, let's do this in `pom.xml` file: 
[source,xml]
----
<project>
    ...
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.cayenne</groupId>
            <artifactId>cayenne</artifactId>
            <version>${cayenne.version}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
----

Additionally we need to tell `Maven compiler plugin` that our code uses Java 11:
[source,xml]
----
<build>
    <plugins>
    ...
        <plugin>
            <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
            <configuration>
                <source>11</source>
                <target>11</target>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    ...
----

If all done right your code now shouldn't have any errors. To be sure you can build it:

----
$ mvn compile
----
