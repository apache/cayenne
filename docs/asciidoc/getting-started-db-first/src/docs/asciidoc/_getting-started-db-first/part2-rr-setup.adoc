=== Reverse engineering database

Now we have everything ready and can proceed to importing Cayenne model from our Mysql database

==== Configuring plugin

To let Cayenne plugin do its job we must tell it what to import and where it should get data.
So let's begin, here is sample settings for the data source: 
[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    ...
    <configuration>
        <dataSource>
            <driver>com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</driver>
            <url>jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/cayenne_demo</url>
            <username>root</username>
            <password>your-mysql-password</password>
        </dataSource>
    </configuration>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.mysql</groupId>
            <artifactId>mysql-connector-j</artifactId>
            <version>8.2.0</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
----

NOTE: Don't forget to set your actual MySQL login and password

We have told plugin where it should load data from, now let's set where it should store Cayenne model: 
[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
    ...
    </dataSource>
    <cayenneProject>${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/cayenne/cayenne-project.xml</cayenneProject>
    <map>${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/datamap.map.xml</map>
    ...
----

And a last small step we need to do is to set default package where our model classes will be
and catalog where our tables are:
[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
    ...</map>
    <dbImport>
        <defaultPackage>org.apache.cayenne.tutorial.persistent</defaultPackage>
        <catalog>cayenne_demo</catalog>
    </dbImport>
----

==== Running plugin

Finally we can run db import, it is as easy as just running this command in terminal:
----
$ mvn cayenne:cdbimport
----

If everything was setup properly you should see output like this: 
----
...

[INFO] Migration Complete Successfully.

You can open created `datamap.map.xml` file and check it's content in IDEA: 

image::tutorial-new-datamap.png[align="center"]

Great! We now have Cayenne DataMap file that describe model from our database and cayenne-project.xml file.

NOTE: If you have some problems with configuration you can always delete `datamap.map.xml` file and try again.

==== Setup Modeler Maven plugin

Cayenne Modeler can be helpful in case you want to make some customizations to your model, though it's usage optional.

To launch Modeler we'll use ``cayenne-modeler-maven-plugin``.
Just include it in `pom.xml` like we did with ``cayenne-maven-plugin`` and tell where your project is:
[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.cayenne.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>cayenne-modeler-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${cayenne.version}</version>
    <configuration>
        <modelFile>${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/cayenne-project.xml</modelFile>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

To launch it simply run:
----
$ mvn cayenne-modeler:run
----
