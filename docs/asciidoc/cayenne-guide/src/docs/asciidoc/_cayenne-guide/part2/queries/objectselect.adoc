==== ObjectSelect

NOTE: `ObjectSelect` supersedes older `SelectQuery`. `SelectQuery` is deprecated since 4.2 and removed in 5.0.

===== Selecting objects

`ObjectSelect` is the most commonly used query in Cayenne applications. This may be the only query you will ever need.
It returns a list of persistent objects (or data rows) of a certain type specified in the query:

[source, java]
----
List<Artist> objects = ObjectSelect.query(Artist.class).select(context);
----

This returned all rows in the _ARTIST_ table. If the logs were turned on, you might see the following SQL printed:

[source]
----
INFO: SELECT t0.DATE_OF_BIRTH, t0.NAME, t0.ID FROM ARTIST t0
INFO: === returned 5 row. - took 5 ms.
----

This SQL was generated by Cayenne from the `ObjectSelect` above.
`ObjectSelect` can have a qualifier to select only the data matching specific criteria.
Qualifier is simply an Expression (Expressions where discussed in the <<Expressions,previous chapter>>),
appended to the query using "where" method. If you only want artists whose name begins with 'Pablo',
you might use the following qualifier expression:

[source, java]
----
List<Artist> objects = ObjectSelect.query(Artist.class)
    .where(Artist.NAME.like("Pablo%"))
    .select(context);
----

The SQL will look different this time:

[source]
----
INFO: SELECT t0.DATE_OF_BIRTH, t0.NAME, t0.ID FROM ARTIST t0 WHERE t0.NAME LIKE ?
[bind: 1->NAME:'Pablo%']
INFO: === returned 1 row. - took 6 ms.
----

`ObjectSelect` allows to assemble qualifier from parts, using "and" and "or" method to chain them together:

[source, java]
----
List<Artist> objects = ObjectSelect.query(Artist.class)
    .where(Artist.NAME.like("A%"))
    .and(Artist.DATE_OF_BIRTH.gt(someDate)
    .select(context);
----

To order the results of `ObjectSelect`, one or more orderings can be applied:

[source, java]
----
List<Artist> objects = ObjectSelect.query(Artist.class)
    .orderBy(Artist.DATE_OF_BIRTH.desc())
    .orderBy(Artist.NAME.asc())
    .select(context);
----

There's a number of other useful methods in `ObjectSelect` that define what to select
and how to optimize database interaction (prefetching, caching, fetch offset and limit, pagination, etc.).
Some of them are discussed in separate chapters on caching and performance optimization.
Others are fairly self-explanatory. Please check the API docs for the full extent of the `ObjectSelect` features.

===== Selecting individual columns

`ObjectSelect` query can be used to fetch individual properties of objects via type-safe API:

[source, java]
----
List<String> names = ObjectSelect.columnQuery(Artist.class, Artist.ARTIST_NAME)
    .select(context);
----

And here is an example of selecting several properties. The result is a list of `Object[]`:

[source, java]
----
List<Object[]> nameAndDate = ObjectSelect
    .columnQuery(Artist.class, Artist.ARTIST_NAME, Artist.DATE_OF_BIRTH)
    .select(context);
----

===== Selecting using aggregate functions

ObjectSelect query supports usage of aggregate functions.
Most common variant of aggregation is selecting count of records, this can be done really easy:

[source, java]
----
long count = ObjectSelect.query(Artist.class).selectCount(context);
----

But you can use aggregates in more cases, even combine selecting individual properties and aggregates:

[source, java]
----
// Artist.SELF - is a special property that denotes a full object in this case
List<Object[]> artistAndPaintingCount = ObjectSelect.columnQuery(Artist.class,
        Artist.SELF,
        Artist.PAINTING_ARRAY.count())
    .where(Artist.ARTIST_NAME.like("a%"))
    .having(Artist.PAINTING_ARRAY.count().lt(5L))
    .orderBy(Artist.PAINTING_ARRAY.count().desc(), Artist.ARTIST_NAME.asc())
    .select(context);

for(Object[] next : artistAndPaintingCount) {
    Artist artist = (Artist)next[0];
    long paintings = (Long)next[1];
    System.out.println(artist.getArtistName() + " have " + paintings + " paintings");
}
----

Here is generated `SQL` for this query:

[source, SQL]
----
SELECT DISTINCT t0.ARTIST_NAME, t0.DATE_OF_BIRTH, t0.ARTIST_ID, COUNT(t1.PAINTING_ID)
FROM ARTIST t0 JOIN PAINTING t1 ON (t0.ARTIST_ID = t1.ARTIST_ID)
WHERE t0.ARTIST_NAME LIKE ?
GROUP BY t0.ARTIST_NAME, t0.ARTIST_ID, t0.DATE_OF_BIRTH
HAVING COUNT(t1.PAINTING_ID) < ?
ORDER BY COUNT(t1.PAINTING_ID) DESC, t0.ARTIST_NAME
----

===== Subqueries

Since Cayenne 4.2 `ObjectSelect` supports subqueries, and since 5.0 subqueries API is greatly improved.
Here is an example of a basic `NOT EXISTS` subquery:

[source, java]
----
long count = ObjectSelect.query(Artist.class)
        .where(Artist.PAINTING_ARRAY.notExists())
        .selectCount(context);
----

And here's a generated `SQL`:

[source, SQL]
----
SELECT COUNT( * )
FROM ARTIST t0
WHERE
    NOT EXISTS (SELECT t1.PAINTING_ID
                FROM PAINTING t1
                WHERE t1.ARTIST_ID = t0.ARTIST_ID
    )
