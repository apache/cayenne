=== Including Cayenne in a Project

==== Maven

To add Cayenne to your Maven project, include `cayenne` in your POM:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.apache.cayenne</groupId>
   <artifactId>cayenne</artifactId>
   <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
----

==== Gradle

To add Cayenne to your Gradle project, include `cayenne` module:

[source, Groovy,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
compile 'org.apache.cayenne:cayenne:{version}'
----

==== Ant, etc.

If your environment requires manual dependency management (like Ant), check `lib` and `lib/third-party` folders of
Cayenne distribution. It contains all Cayenne jars as well as the minimal set of third-party libraries to get you
started.
