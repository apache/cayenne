=== CayenneModeler Application

==== Reverse Engineering Database

See chapter <<Reverse Engineering in Cayenne Modeler>>

==== Generating Database Schema

With Cayenne Modeler you can create simple database schemas without any additional database tools. This is a good option for initial database setup if you completely created you model with the Modeler. You can start SQL schema generation by selecting menu *Tools > Generate Database Schema*

You can select what database parts should be generated and what tables you want

==== Generating Java Classes

Before using Cayenne in you code you need to generate java source code for persistent objects. This can be done with Modeler GUI or via <<cgen>> maven/ant plugin.

To generate classes in the modeler use *Tools > Generate Classes*

There is three default types of code generation

- *Standard Persistent Objects*

Default type of generation suitable for almost all cases. Use this type unless you now what exactly you need to customize.

- *Advanced*

In advanced mode you can control almost all aspects of code generation including custom templates for java code. See default Cayenne templates on GitHub as an example.

==== Modeling Generic Persistent Classes

Normally each ObjEntity is mapped to a specific Java class (such as Artist or Painting) that explicitly declare all entity properties as pairs of getters and setters. However, Cayenne allows to map a completely generic class to any number of entities. The only expectation is that a generic class implements `org.apache.cayenne.Persistent`. So an ideal candidate for a generic class is `GenericPersistentObject`, or some custom subclass of `GenericPersistentObject`.

If you don't enter anything for Java Class of an ObjEntity, Cayenne assumes generic mapping and uses the following implicit rules to determine a class of a generic object. If DataMap "Custom Superclass" is set, runtime uses this class to instantiate new objects. If not, `org.apache.cayenne.GenericPersistentObject` is used.

Class generation procedures (either done in the Modeler or with Ant or Maven) would skip entities that are mapped to `GenericPersistentObject` explicitly or have no class mapping.

==== Modeling Primary Key Generation Strategy

Cayenne supports three PK generation strategies:

1. *Cayenne Generated*.
This is default strategy. Cayenne will use special table `AUTO_PK_SUPPORT` for managing primary keys.

2. *Database Generated*.
Cayenne will delegate PK generation to database (e.g. auto increment fields on MySQL or `serial` type on PostgreSQL)

3. *Custom Sequence*. In this case Cayenne will use provided sequence to generate primary keys.

Strategy should be set per each `DbEntity` independently.
