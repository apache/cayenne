=== Reverse Engineering in Cayenne Modeler

Alternative approach to using <<re-introduction,build tools>> is doing reverse engineering from <<CayenneModeler Application, CayenneModeler>>.

You can find reverse engineering tool in dataMap view on *DbImport Tab*.

==== Reverse engineering options

Reverse Engineering dialog.

Here is a list of options to tune what will be processed by reverse engineering:

- *Add Catalog*

- *Add Schema*

- *Add Include Table*

- *Add Exclude Table*

- *Add Include Column*

- *Add Exclude Column*

- *Add Include Procedure*

- *Add Exclude Procedure*

- *Tables with Meaningful PK Pattern*: Comma separated list of RegExp's for tables that you want to have meaningful primary keys. By default no meaningful PKs are created.

- *Strip from table names*: Regex that matches the part of the table name that needs to be stripped off generating ObjEntity name.

- *Skip relationships loading*: Whether to load relationships.

- *Skip primary key loading*: Whether to load primary keys.

- *Force datamap catalog*: will set DbEntity catalog to one in the DataMap.

- *Force datamap schema*: will set DbEntity schema to one in the DataMap.

- *Use Java primitive types*: Use primitive types (e.g. *int*) or Object types (e.g. *java.lang.Integer*).

- *Use old java.util.Date type*: Use *java.util.Date* for all columns with *DATE/TIME/TIMESTAMP* types. By default *java.time.* types will be used.

==== DataSource selection

Then you click `Run Import` or `Configure Connection` to set DataSource.
If you don't have any DataSource yet you can create one from this menu.

Then click `continue` to start dbImport.
