== Build Tools

While we encourage the use of <<cayenne-modeler,CayenneModeler>> for tasks such as DB reverse-engineering and
code generation, Cayenne also provides an option to execute them from your preferred build tool.
It may be occasionally useful to keep them as a part of the build. This chapter shows how to use them in
<<maven_plugin,Maven>>, <<gradle_plugin,Gradle>> or <<ant_tasks,Ant>>.
