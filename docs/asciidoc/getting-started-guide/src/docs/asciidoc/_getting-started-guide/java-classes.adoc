=== Creating Java Classes
Here we'll generate the Java classes from the model that was created in the previous
section. CayenneModeler can be used to also generate the database schema, but since we
specified "`CreateIfNoSchemaStrategy`" earlier when we created a DataNode, we'll skip the
database schema step. Still be aware that you can do it if you need to via "Tools >
Create Database Schema".

==== Creating Java Classes
- Select your datamap in a project tree and open "Class Generation" tab.
- For "Type" select "Standard Persistent Objects", if it is not already selected.
- For the "Output Directory" select "`src/main/java`" folder under your IDEA
project folder (this is a "peer" location to the `cayenne-*.xml` location we
selected before).
- Select all object entities (unless they are already checked).
- Finally, click "Generate"

Now go back to IDEA - you
should see pairs of classes generated for each mapped entity. You probably also see that
there's a bunch of red squiggles next to the newly generated Java classes in IDEA.
This is because our project does not include Cayenne as a Maven dependency yet. Let's
fix it now by adding "cayenne" artifact in the bottom of the `pom.xml` file.
Also we should tell Maven compile plugin that our project needs Java 8.
The resulting POM should look like this:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>org.example.cayenne</groupId>
    <artifactId>tutorial</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>

    <properties>
        <cayenne.version>{project-version}</cayenne.version> <!--1-->
        <maven.compiler.source>11</maven.compiler.source> <!--2-->
        <maven.compiler.target>11</maven.compiler.target>
    </properties>

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.cayenne</groupId>
            <artifactId>cayenne</artifactId>
            <version>${cayenne.version}</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
            <artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>
            <version>1.7.36</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</project>

<1> Here you can specify the version of Cayenne you are actually using
<2> Tell Maven to support Java 11

Your computer must be connected to the internet. Once you edit the `pom.xml`, IDEA
will download the needed Cayenne jar file and add it to the project build path. As a
result, all the errors should disappear. In tutorial for console output we use slf4j-simple logger
implementation. Due to use SLF4J logger in Apache Cayenne, you can use your custom logger (e.g. log4j
or commons-logging) through bridges.

Now let's check the entity class pairs. Each one is made of a superclass (e.g. `auto/\_Artist`)
and a subclass (e.g. `Artist`). You *should not* modify the
superclasses whose names start with "_" (underscore), as they will be replaced on
subsequent generator runs. Instead all custom logic should be placed in the subclasses
in `org.example.cayenne.persistent` package - those will never be overwritten by the
class generator.

[TIP]
.Class Generation Hint
====
Often you'd start by generating classes from the
Modeler, but at the later stages of the project the generation is usually
automated either via Ant cgen task or Maven cgen mojo. All three methods are
interchangeable, however Ant and Maven methods would ensure that you never
forget to regenerate classes on mapping changes, as they are integrated into
the build cycle.
