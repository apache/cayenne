=== Starting a project

The goal of this chapter is to create a new Java project in IntelliJ IDEA
containing a basic Cayenne mapping. It presents an introduction to
CayenneModeler GUI tool, showing how to create the initial mapping
objects: `DataDomain`, `DataNode`, `DataMap`.

==== Create a new Project in IntelliJ IDEA

In IntelliJ IDEA select `File > New > Project..` and then
select `Maven` and click `Next`.
In the dialog shown on the screenshot below, fill the `Group Id`
and `Artifact Id` fields and click `Next`.

On next dialog screen you can customize directory for your project and click `Finish`.
Now you should have a new empty project.

==== Download and Start CayenneModeler

Although later in this tutorial we'll be using Maven to include Cayenne
runtime jars in the project, you'll still need to download Cayenne to
get access to the CayenneModeler tool.

NOTE: If you are really into Maven, you can start CayenneModeler from Maven too.
      We'll do it in a more traditional way here.

Download the https://cayenne.apache.org/download.html[latest release]. Unpack the distribution
somewhere in the file system and start CayenneModeler, following platform-specific instructions.
On most platforms it is done simply by doubleclicking the Modeler icon.
The welcome screen of the Modeler looks like this:

==== Create a New Mapping Project in CayenneModeler

Click on the `New Project` button on Welcome screen. A new mapping project will appear
that contains a single *DataDomain*. The meaning of a
DataDomain is explained elsewhere in the User Guide. For now it is sufficient to
understand that DataDomain is the root of your mapping project.

==== Create a DataNode

The next project object you will create is a *DataNode*.
DataNode is a descriptor of a single database your application
will connect to. Cayenne mapping project can use more than one database, but for now,
we'll only use one. With "project" selected on the left, click on `Create DataNode` button image:icon-node.png[]
on the toolbar (or select `Project > Create DataNode` from the menu).

A new DataNode is displayed. Now you need to specify JDBC connection parameters. For
an in-memory Derby database you can enter the following settings:

- JDBC Driver: `org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver`
- DB URL: `jdbc:derby:memory:testdb;create=true`

NOTE: We are creating an in-memory database here. So when
      you stop your application, all the data will be lost. In most real-life
      cases you'll be connecting to a database that actually persists its data on
      disk, but an in-memory DB will do for the simple tutorial.

Also you will need to change "Schema Update Strategy". Select
`org.apache.cayenne.access.dbsync.CreateIfNoSchemaStrategy` from the dropdown, so that
Cayenne creates a new schema on Derby based on the ORM mapping when the application
starts.

==== Create a DataMap

Now you will create a *DataMap*. DataMap is an object
that holds all the mapping information. To create it, click on "Create DataMap" button
image:icon-datamap.png[] (or select a corresponding menu item).
Note that the newly created DataMap is automatically linked to the DataNode that you created in
the previous step. If there is more than one DataNode, you may need to link a DataMap
to the correct node manually. In other words a DataMap within DataDomain must point
to a database described by the map.

You can leave all the DataMap defaults unchanged except for one - "Java Package".
Enter `org.example.cayenne.persistent`. This name will later be used for all persistent
classes.

==== Save the Project

image::idea-xmlfiles.png[float="right"]

Before you proceed with the actual mapping, let's save the project. Click on "Save"
button in the toolbar and navigate to the `tutorial` IDEA project folder that was
created earlier in this section and its `src/main/resources` subfolder and save the
project there. Now go back to IDEA and you will see two Cayenne XML files.

Note that the location of the XML files is not coincidental. Cayenne runtime looks for
`cayenne-*.xml` file in the application `CLASSPATH` and `src/main/resources` folder should
already be a "class folder" in IDEA for our project (and is also a standard location
that Maven would copy to a jar file, if we were using Maven from command-line).
