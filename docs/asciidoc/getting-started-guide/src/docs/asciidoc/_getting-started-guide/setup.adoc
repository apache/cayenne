== Setting up the environment

The goal of this chapter of the tutorial is to install (or check that you already have
installed) a minimally needed set of software to build a Cayenne application.

=== Install Java

Obviously, JDK has to be installed. Cayenne 5.0 requires JDK 11 or newer.

=== Install IntelliJ IDEA

Download and install IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition.
This tutorial is based on version 2016.3, still it should work with any recent IntelliJ IDEA version.
