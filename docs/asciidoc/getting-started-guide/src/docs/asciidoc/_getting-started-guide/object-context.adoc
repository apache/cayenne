=== Getting started with ObjectContext
In this section we'll write a simple main class to run our application, and get a brief
introduction to Cayenne ObjectContext.

==== Creating the Main Class

- In IDEA create a new class called "`Main`" in the "`org.example.cayenne`" package.
- Create a standard "main" method to make it a runnable class:

[source,java]
----
package org.example.cayenne;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
    }
}
----
- The first thing you need to be able to access the database is to create a
`CayenneRuntime` object (which is essentially a wrapper around Cayenne stack) and
use it to obtain an instance of an `ObjectContext`.

[source,java]
----
package org.example.cayenne;

import org.apache.cayenne.ObjectContext;
import org.apache.cayenne.runtime.CayenneRuntime;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CayenneRuntime cayenneRuntime = CayenneRuntime.builder()
                        .addConfig("cayenne-project.xml")
                        .build();
        ObjectContext context = cayenneRuntime.newContext();
    }
}
----
`ObjectContext` is an isolated "session" in Cayenne that provides all needed API
to work with data. ObjectContext has methods to execute queries and manage
persistent objects. We'll discuss them in the following sections. When the first
ObjectContext is created in the application, Cayenne loads XML mapping files and
creates a shared access stack that is later reused by other ObjectContexts.

==== Running Application
Let's check what happens when you run the application. But before we do that we need
to add another dependency to the `pom.xml` - Apache Derby, our embedded database engine.
The following piece of XML needs to be added to the
`<dependencies>...</dependencies>` section, where we already have Cayenne
jars:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.apache.derby</groupId>
    <artifactId>derby</artifactId>
    <version>10.14.2.0</version>
</dependency>
----
Now we are ready to run. Right click the "Main" class in IDEA and select "Run 'Main.main()'".

In the console you'll see output similar to this, indicating that Cayenne stack has been started:

    INFO: Loading XML configuration resource from file:/.../cayenne-project.xml
    INFO: Loading XML DataMap resource from file:/.../datamap.map.xml
    INFO: loading user name and password.
    INFO: Connecting to 'jdbc:derby:memory:testdb;create=true' as 'null'
    INFO: +++ Connecting: SUCCESS.
    INFO: setting DataNode 'datanode' as default, used by all unlinked DataMaps</screen>
            
==== How to Configure Cayenne Logging
Follow the instructions in the logging chapter to tweak verbosity of the logging output.
