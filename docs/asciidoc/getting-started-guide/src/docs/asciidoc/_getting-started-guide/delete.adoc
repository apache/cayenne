=== Deleting Objects
This chapter explains how to model relationship delete rules and how to delete individual
objects as well as sets of objects. Also demonstrated the use of Cayenne class to run a
query.

==== Setting Up Delete Rules
Before we discuss the API for object deletion, lets go back to CayenneModeler and set
up some delete rules. Doing this is optional but will simplify correct handling of the
objects related to deleted objects.
In the Modeler go to "Artist" ObjEntity, "Relationships" tab and select "Cascade" for
the "paintings" relationship delete rule:

image::modeler-deleterule.png[]
        
Repeat this step for other relationships:

- For Gallery set "paintings" relationship to be "Nullify", as a painting can exist without being displayed in a gallery.
- For Painting set both relationships rules to "Nullify".

Now save the mapping.

==== Deleting Objects
While deleting objects is possible via SQL, qualifying a delete on one or more IDs, a
more common way in Cayenne (or ORM in general) is to get a hold of the object first, and
then delete it via the context. Let's use utility class Cayenne to find an
artist:

[source, java]
----
Artist picasso = ObjectSelect.query(Artist.class)
            .where(Artist.NAME.eq("Pablo Picasso")).selectOne(context);
----

Now let's delete the artist:

[source, java]
----
if (picasso != null) {
    context.deleteObject(picasso);
    context.commitChanges();
}
----
Since we set up "Cascade" delete rule for the Artist.paintings relationships, Cayenne
will automatically delete all paintings of this artist. So when your run the app you'll
see this output:
        
    INFO: SELECT t0.DATE_OF_BIRTH, t0.NAME, t0.ID FROM ARTIST t0
      WHERE t0.NAME = ? [bind: 1->NAME:'Pablo Picasso'] - prepared in 6 ms.
    INFO: === returned 1 row. - took 18 ms.
    INFO: +++ transaction committed.
    INFO: --- transaction started.
    INFO: DELETE FROM PAINTING WHERE ID = ?
    INFO: [batch bind: 1->ID:200]
    INFO: [batch bind: 1->ID:201]
    INFO: === updated 2 rows.
    INFO: DELETE FROM ARTIST WHERE ID = ?
    INFO: [batch bind: 1->ID:200]
    INFO: === updated 1 row.
    INFO: +++ transaction committed.
