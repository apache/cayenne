Apache Cayenne Upgrade Information
==================================

IMPORTANT: be sure to read all notes for the intermediate releases between your
           current release and the release you are upgrading to.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UPGRADING TO 3.2M2

* Minimal required JDK version is now 1.6 (both for modeler and runtime). This is a pretty conservative 
  requirement, considering that even Java 1.6 has been EOL'd by Oracle on Feb 2013.

* Managing listeners in the Modeler is counterproductive and confusing,
  so support for them was removed from the Modeler per CAY-1842. If you have
  any listeners in the model, delete them from XML, and start using annotations,
  and register them in runtime:

  runtime.getDataDomain().addListener(myListener);

* Cayenne.objectForSelect(Select) that was present in 3.2M1 was replaced with ObjectContext.selectOne(Select). 

* In-memory expression eval (Expression.match/Expression.evaluate) will now return true when matching Persistent
  with ObjectId or Number or String (if those correspond to a given object's ObjectId). Also 2 objects in 2 different
  ObjectContexts will match even if they have differing local changes. Only their ObjectIds are compared. 
  See CAY-1860 for details.

* ResultIterator was moved to org.apache.cayenne to make it available on both server and client. When you upgrade
  related iterator code, make sure to check ResultIterator improvements (e.g. it implements Iterable, it is no 
  longer limited to DataRows and can fetch objects just as easy, it no longer requires catching checked exceptions). 
  Also check ObjectContext.iterate(..) method.

UPGRADING TO 3.1B1

* In an attempt to better organize DI configuration and ultimately make it easier to understand, 
  all properties and DI collection keys were placed in a single Constants interface. The property and key String 
  values were changed to follow a single convention. Please refer to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAY-1665
  for mapping between the old and the new names.

  If you are upgrading from the earlier 3.1 releases, please change your code and runtime parameters accordingly.
  3.0 users may still review the new property names as some of them existed prior to DI.

UPGRADING TO 3.1M3

* DataMap listeners are no longer supported. Global listeners registered through
  annotations API can be used instead. E.g.:

	public class SomeListener {
		@PrePersist
		public void onPrePersist(Object object) {
			// callback method
		}
	}

  To register listener class use following API:

	runtime.getChannel().getEntityResolver().getCallbackRegistry().addListener(listenerInstance);

  Note that DataMap listeners entries from old *.map.xml files will be ignored.


UPGRADING TO 3.1M1

The most essential change in Cayenne 3.1 is a new Dependency-Injection (DI) based
bootstrap and configuration mechanism, which is not backwards compatible with 3.0.
Read on to learn about specific areas that require attention when upgrading your
application.

* Upgrading 3.0.x mapping files: Open each of your existing projects in the new 
  CayenneModeler. Agree to perform an upgrade when asked. Note that Cayenne
  3.1 only supports one DataDomain per project, so if multiple domains existed in 
  the project, you'll end up with multiple project files  after the upgrade. Each 
  will require instantiation of a separate ServerRuntime in the code. 

* Upgrading 2.0.x and earlier mappings files: Note that CayenneModeler
  3.1 won't be able to upgrade projects created with a Modeler older than 3.0. To 
  upgrade older projects do it in two steps - download Cayenne 3.0, and perform an
  upgrade with 3.0 CayenneModeler. After that perform a second upgrade from 3.0 to
  3.1.

* Cayenne runtime bootstrap: In 3.1 all classes under "org.apache.cayenne.conf"
  package were removed, superseded by dependency injection (DI) based configuration,
  with main classes located under "org.apache.cayenne.configuration" and its 
  subpackages. E.g. to instantiate the Cayenne stack in 3.1 you would do 
  something like that:

  ServerRuntime cayenneRuntime = new ServerRuntime("cayenne-UntitledDomain.xml");
  
  To obtain a new ObjectContext, the following API is used:
		
  ObjectContext context = cayenneRuntime.getContext();

* No static configuration singleton: Cayenne 3.1 completely gets rid of a (previously 
  optional, but widely used) "Configuration.sharedConfiguration" singleton. This 
  change was done to acknowledge the fact that single configuration per application 
  is just a special case, and generally user can instantiate as many configurations 
  (or ServerRuntime's in 3.1 terms) as appropriate. This however means that the 
  users must now decide themselves where in their application it is appropriate to 
  store ServerRuntime instance (or instances). E.g. it can be stored as an attribute 
  of ServletContext (check out "org.apache.cayenne.configuration.web.CayenneFilter" and 
  "org.apache.cayenne.configuration.web.WebUtil"), reside in a user's favorite dependency
  injection container (e.g. Spring), or even be saved in a user's own static singleton 
  variable.

* No static DataContext creation methods: Methods like DataContext.createDataContext()
  were relying on static configuration singleton, which was removed (see above). Use
  ServerRuntime instance methods to create context instances.

* Webapp configuration changes: "org.apache.cayenne.conf.WebApplicationContextFilter"
  was replaced by "org.apache.cayenne.configuration.web.CayenneFilter". See CayenneFilter
  javadocs for details on of the init parameters.

* ROP Server configuration changes: "org.apache.cayenne.remote.hessian.service.HessianServlet"
  was replaced by "org.apache.cayenne.configuration.rop.server.ROPHessianServlet". See
  ROPHessianServlet javadocs for details on its init parameters. 

* ROP Client configuration changes: There is now a special DI "runtime" object -
  "org.apache.cayenne.configuration.rop.client.ClientRuntime", so client connection
  and channel can be (optionally) managed via DI, with connection parameters 
  specified as properties. E.g.:
  
	Map<String, String> properties = new HashMap<String, String>();
	properties.put(ClientModule.ROP_SERVICE_URL, "http://localhost:8080/tutorial/cayenne-service");
	properties.put(ClientModule.ROP_SERVICE_USER_NAME, "cayenne-user");
	properties.put(ClientModule.ROP_SERVICE_PASSWORD, "secret");

	ClientRuntime runtime = new ClientRuntime(properties);
	ObjectContext context = runtime.getContext();
	
  The advantage of this approach in that all the client stack objects are managed
  by the DI container and a user can customize/override various pieces.

* Deprecated API removal: All API deprecated as of 3.0 is removed. This may require 
  some code cleanup. Since 3.0 javadocs for suggested replacements. Also if custom 
  class generation templates are used, doublecheck that they do not reference removed 
  EntityUtil methods, which were replaced by variables placed directly into Velocity context.

* Custom DbAdapter / DbAdapterFactory: The interface used by Cayenne to allow custom 
  DbAdapters to be auto-detected with AutoAdapter has changed from 
  org.apache.cayenne.dba.DbAdapterFactory to org.apache.cayenne.configuration.DbAdapterDetector. 
  Note that now a custom implementation can rely on Cayenne DI to obtain Cayenne 
  dependencies via @Inject annotation. To register a custom implementation with 
  Cayenne DI container, one might do this in the custom DI module:

  ... 
  public void configure(Binder binder) {
  ...
     binder.bindList(DbAdapterFactory.class).add(new MyDbAdapterDetector());
  }

* Custom DataSourceFactory: The interface used by Cayenne to load custom DataSource 
  factories has changed from "org.apache.cayenne.conf.DataSourceFactory" to 
  "org.apache.cayenne.configuration.DataSourceFactory". This new interface must be 
  implemented by the custom factories. Note that now a custom implementation can 
  rely on Cayenne DI to obtain Cayenne dependencies via @Inject annotation.

* Replaced JNDI preferences hack with runtime properties: "JNDI hack", as it was 
  known prior to 3.1, allowed to define a named database connection using CayenneModeler, 
  and then Cayenne would read this connection information from Modeler preferences 
  and use it as a failover for JNDI DataNodes. The problem with this is that it 
  required CayenneModeler and HSQLDB jars on the application classpath, and also that the 
  preferences database was prone to data corruption. In 3.1, preferences hack is no
  longer available. Instead JNDI (or really any other type of DataSourceFactory) 
  can be overridden via runtime properties (or by redefining DataSourceFactoryLoader
  via DI). See org.apache.cayenne.configuration.server.PropertyDataSourceFactory javadocs for
  details. Here are some simple examples:

  -Dcayenne.jdbc.url=jdbc://urloverride 
  -Dcayenne.jdbc.driver=com.example.MyDriver 
  -Dcayenne.jdbc.username=foo
  -Dcayenne.jdbc.password=bar


UPGRADING TO 3.0B1

* Per CAY-1281 pre-persist callback was renamed to post-add (while pre-persist now has a different meaning).
  To upgrade your project, open it in the Modeler and agree to perform an automated upgrade.

UPGRADING TO 3.0M6

* Per CAY-1154, org.apache.cayenne.access.reveng package was renamed to org.apache.cayenne.map.naming. So, if you
  use your own naming strategies, you should update as well.

* Per CAY-1161, custom columns feature in SelectQuery was deprecated. Consider switching to EJBQL as an alternative.
  Custom columns support will likely go away completely after 3.0M6.

* Per CAY-1175, 'columnNameCapitalization' property of SQLTemplate now takes an enum, not a String. 
  Calling code should be fixed.

UPGRADING TO 3.0M5

* Per CAY-1127, query "name" property is no longer used as an internal cache key. This change should be transparent
  to most users, as Cayenne generates a correct cache key internally when needed, however if a user code explicitly
  depended on the value of the cache key, it should be updated to use something like this:
    
  String cacheKey = query.getQueryMetadata(entityResolver).getCacheKey();

UPGRADING TO 3.0M4

* Per CAY-1049 API of the internal classes that participate in SelectQuery translation has changed in a way that
  is not backwards compatible. This should not affect regular users, however if you implemented a custom DbAdapter,
  check for classes that directly or indirectly inherit from QueryAssembler and QueryAssemblerHelper and fix them
  if needed.

UPGRADING TO 3.0M3

* Java 5 is now required as a minimum for Cayenne Modeler and the Cayenne libraries.

* After the move to Java 5, generics have been implemented in many of the Cayenne APIs. If you don't use generics in your project this should not affect you, but if you do you will need to review any new compiler errors or warnings. The effect of generics is at compile time only, so their introduction will not change the runtime behaviour of your application once compiled.

UPGRADING TO 3.0M2

* Lifecycle Callbacks require no setup:
  Per CAY-843, lifecycle callback functionality is now built into DataContext and DataDomain, 
  so all the custom code to set them up is no longer needed. Also as a result of this change
  'org.apache.cayenne.intercept' package is removed from Cayenne.
  Further information can be found here: http://cayenne.apache.org/doc/lifecycle-callbacks.html

UPGRADING TO 3.0M1

* Jar files:
  - all jar files now include version numbers in their names.
  - "cayenne-nodeps.jar" is renamed to "cayenne-server-x.x.x.jar" 
  - "fat" cayenne.jar file that included dependencies is no longer distributed. 
    All dependencies that it contained are included as separate jars under 
    "cayenne-x.x.x/lib/third-party/". The new "cayenne-server-x.x.x.jar" plus 
    dependencies should be used in place of cayenne.jar.
  - A new "cayenne-agent-x.x.x.jar" is included. It is used for class enhancement 
    with POJO's and JPA. "Classic" Cayenne users can ignore this file.
    
* Ant class generator is using what was called "version 1.2" by default. This means that if you were
  using custom Velocity templates in 1.1 mode, you should either change the templates or specify 'version="1.1"'
  in the buildfile explicitly.

* Cross-platform Modeler Startup is now done without a batch file or a shell script. 
  A "fat" CayenneModeler.jar is included in the "cayenne-x.x.x/bin" directory
  and can be run either by double-clicking the jar (on platforms that support that)
  or by running "java -jar CayenneModeler.jar".
  
* Note that FireBird adapter is no longer distributed with Cayenne. The one we had was half-working
  and we could not support it anymore.
  
* DataContextTransactionEventListener, DataObjectTransactionEventListener, DataContextEvent all were deprecated
  favor of callbacks. NOTE THAT THIS API WILL BE REMOVED IN THE FOLLOWING 3.0 MILESTONES.
  
* Long PK: Cayenne now supports "long" primary key generation (previously it only supported "int"). You may
  have to change the existing PK lookup tables on some databases to take advantage of that (this is optional,
  and is needed if you expect your PK to exceed maximum value of an "int" allowed in your database). E.g. on 
  MySQL you may run the following SQL:
  
  ALTER TABLE AUTO_PK_SUPPORT CHANGE COLUMN NEXT_ID NEXT_ID BIGINT NOT NULL;
  

UPGRADING TO 2.0.x

Since 2.0, Cayenne is an Apache project, so all "org.objectstyle.*" java packages 
where renamed to "org.apache.*" analogues. Since 1.2.x and 2.0.x release lines maintain
full compatibility with each other, differing only in package names, upgrading to 2.0.x
can be a first step in a safe upgrade to the latest version of Cayenne.

* Upgrading mapping files:

To upgrade the mapping files, open them in the new Modeler. You should see an upgrade 
dialog. Once you confirm the upgrade 

* Upgrading the code:

Replace "org.objectstyle." with "org.apache." everywhere in imports and do a clean 
recompile.

* Upgrading logging configuration

If you are using custom logging configuration file, make sure that all the 
Cayenne loggers are changed from "org.objectstyle" to "org.apache".
