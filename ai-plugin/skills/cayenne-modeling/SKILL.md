description: "Use this skill whenever the user wants to edit, inspect, or extend the Cayenne ORM model in a project — adding or modifying entities, attributes, relationships, embeddables, named queries, stored procedures, or DataNodes. Trigger on phrases like 'add an ObjEntity', 'add a DbEntity', 'add a relationship', 'expose this column as an attribute', 'create a new DataMap', 'add a named query', 'create an embeddable', 'add a stored procedure', 'change the attribute type', 'mark this column as nullable', 'rename this entity', or any mention of a Cayenne `*.map.xml` or `cayenne-*.xml` file. Also trigger when the user references modeling concepts (ObjEntity, DbEntity, ObjAttribute, DbAttribute, ObjRelationship, DbRelationship, Embeddable, dbEntityName, deleteRule, db-attribute-path, db-relationship-path, defaultPackage) in the context of a Cayenne-using app. This is the *primary* skill for a-la-carte ORM model manipulation — direct XML edits, not the Modeler GUI."

# cayenne-modeling

Edit Cayenne DataMap (`*.map.xml`) and project descriptor (`cayenne-*.xml`) files directly. This is the **default path** for granular model changes — adding one entity, one relationship, one query. Use the Modeler GUI (`cayenne-modeler` skill) only for inherently visual work like reverse engineering.

## Required reading

Read these before making any edit — they describe the XML formats this skill operates on:

- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/project-layout.md` — locate the project descriptor and DataMaps in the user's repo.
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/datamap-schema.md` — every element shape for `*.map.xml`.
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/project-descriptor-schema.md` — `cayenne-*.xml` shape.

## Step 1 — Locate the right file

Follow `project-layout.md`. If the user has multiple Cayenne projects and the request is ambiguous, ask which one. Cache the answer for the rest of the session.

Decide whether the change belongs in a DataMap or the project descriptor (table at the end of `project-layout.md`):

- Entity/relationship/query/embeddable/procedure → DataMap (`*.map.xml`).
- DataMap list, DataNode (DB connection) → project descriptor (`cayenne-*.xml`).

## Step 2 — Make the edit

Apply the change following the schema in `datamap-schema.md` or `project-descriptor-schema.md`.

### Critical rules

1. **Element order matters.** The DataMap schema requires this order inside `<data-map>`: `<property>`, `<procedure>`, `<embeddable>`, `<db-entity>`, `<obj-entity>`, `<db-relationship>`, `<obj-relationship>`, `<query>`, `<cgen>`, `<dbImport>`. Insert at the right place — don't append blindly.

2. **Cross-link consistently.**
   - An `<obj-entity>` references a `<db-entity>` by `dbEntityName="..."`. Make sure that DbEntity exists.
   - An `<obj-attribute>` references a DbAttribute by `db-attribute-path="COLUMN_NAME"`. Make sure that column exists on the DbEntity (or on a related one if using a dotted path through a relationship).
   - An `<obj-relationship>` requires a backing `<db-relationship>` (or chain of them) via `db-relationship-path`. Never add an ObjRelationship without the DB-layer counterpart.
   - Most FKs need **two** `<db-relationship>` entries, one per direction. They are not auto-derived.

3. **Use the right `type` on attributes.**
   - `db-attribute type` — JDBC type names: `VARCHAR`, `INTEGER`, `BIGINT`, `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`, `BOOLEAN`, `NUMERIC`, `BLOB`, `CLOB`, `VARBINARY`, etc. VARCHAR/CHAR/VARBINARY also need `length`. NUMERIC/DECIMAL also need `scale`.
   - `obj-attribute type` — Java FQN: `java.lang.String`, `java.lang.Integer`, `java.util.Date`, `java.math.BigDecimal`, `byte[]`, etc. Use wrapper types (`Integer`, not `int`) for nullable columns.

4. **PK handling.** PK columns get `isPrimaryKey="true" isMandatory="true"` on the DbAttribute. They are normally **not** mirrored as ObjAttributes — Cayenne handles them implicitly. Map a PK as an ObjAttribute only if the user wants a "meaningful PK" (visible on the Java side).

5. **Preserve formatting.** Match the indentation and quote style of the file (the standard Cayenne style uses tabs and double quotes, but follow what's actually in the file you're editing).

## Step 3 — Validate the edit conceptually

After writing the XML, mentally walk through:

- Does every `obj-entity.dbEntityName` resolve to an existing `<db-entity>`?
- Does every `obj-attribute.db-attribute-path` resolve to a column on the right DbEntity?
- Does every `obj-relationship.db-relationship-path` resolve to a chain of existing `<db-relationship>` entries?
- Are PK and FK columns marked `isMandatory="true"` where the DB enforces NOT NULL?

If anything fails, fix it before reporting done.

## Step 4 — Offer the right next step

- **If you modified entities and the DataMap has a `<cgen>` block:** suggest invoking the `cayenne-cgen` skill to regenerate Java classes. Mention which entities are affected.
- **If the user added a new entity and there's no Java class yet:** same — recommend `cayenne-cgen`.
- **If the user is asking about a full DB sync** (importing many tables, syncing with a changed schema): hand off to `cayenne-reverse-engineer`. Do not try to script this via XML edits.
- **If the change is structurally messy** (bulk renaming relationships, visual graph rework): suggest the `cayenne-modeler` skill. Otherwise do not.

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't hand-edit `_<Entity>.java` superclass files.** They are regenerated by cgen and your changes will be overwritten. Edit the user `<Entity>.java` subclass instead.
- **Don't add an `obj-relationship` without a `db-relationship`.** Cayenne will validate-fail at runtime.
- **Don't use primitive Java types (`int`, `long`, `boolean`) as `obj-attribute type` for nullable columns.** Primitives can't represent NULL. Use wrappers.
- **Don't reorder existing elements.** The schema requires the order documented above; reordering existing elements may also create noisy diffs.
- **Don't run cgen yourself.** That's `cayenne-cgen`'s job — invoke that skill instead of calling the MCP tool directly here.
- **Don't suggest `mvn cayenne:cdbimport` or any Maven/Gradle plugin goal.** Those are explicitly out of scope for this plugin.
