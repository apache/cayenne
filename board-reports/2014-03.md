# Apache Cayenne Board Report - March 2014

Apache Cayenne is a Java persistence framework. It takes a distinct approach to object persistence and provides an ORM runtime, remote persistence services, and a GUI mapping/modeling tool.

## Project Status

* Cayenne 3.1 Release Candidate 1 was released on Feb 18.
* New feature development continues for Cayenne 3.2.
* Git migration got stalled (mainly lack of time among the champions to restart a consversaion with infra). Looking for ways to get it back on track.

## Community

* Mailing list activity is about average on developer and user lists.
* The last PMC member was added in December 2012.
* The last committer was added in May 2012.
* We have a new, but steady contributor who submitted a number of patches for Cayenne 3.2 in the last quarter.
